{"text": "I had the best experience here because of the friendly staff that went above and beyond to make sure I found the perfect dress. I first saw my dress online, the designer is Justin Alexander, I called and let them know I just wanted to try it on. I told the receptionist my budget to insure that it was within it so that I wouldn't get disappointed trying on a dress I couldn't afford. She said it was in my budget and we set the date for a try on. I brought one of my bridesmaids with me, my mom lives out of town and wasn't coming for a visit until the end of the month and I was not going to purchase anything without her blessing. When we walked in we were greeted with smiles and I was introduced to my consultant. Rochelle was amazing, she was a great listener and never once pressured me into a purchase. At the end we left without the dress but made a second appointment for when my mom could attend. When we came back I requested Rochelle to help me and she made the experience a once in a lifetime for me and mom. My mom and grandma both cried seeing me in my dress. Now I'm a 34DD but a size 2 everywhere else so my dress was ordered in a size 16 to fit my boobs. I was very concerned over the size but was reassured by Rochelle that they would altar it perfectly to my body. That's when I meet Irene,  she added straps to match the belt of the dress and custom formed it to my body and in the end it was a perfect fit. Instead of string to bustle the dress she used snaps and my maid of honor loved her for that. Irene suggested snaps because of how heavy the dress was. On the day of pick up both Irene and Rochelle were there to make sure that everything went as planned. I tried on the dress one more time with my mom and maid of honor so that they could be shown how to bustle the dress. I am so thankful to everyone at this lovely shop for not only giving me the experience I see on TV such as say yes to the dress but for providing me the dress of my dreams!

They offer several other options as well, such as pork spare ribs, chopped brisket, sausage, turkey, and beef short ribs(only fri & sat). The meat basically melts in your month and is seasoned to perfection. \n\nThe sides were awesome as well. I went with ranch style beans and potato salad. The potato salad needs a little recipe tweaking but it was still quite good. The beans however were insane. They mix finely shredded brisket inside the mix and were the perfect combination of sweet & spicy.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a tiny building with only 5 tables inside and a few outside as well. The parking lot only holds about 25 cars. The best piece of advice I can give is to get there early. They are only open from 11-4(unless they run out of meat before 4, which I hear happens a lot).  \n\nAlso be prepared to wait, wait, and wait some more! The place is insanely popular and the wait just to get in the parking lot was 30 minutes (Next time I'm parking down the street somewhere and just hoofing it). The line to get in to order was at least 50 people deep. They do provide cold water and have a mostly covered waiting area along with misters. They have only 3 people inside working the counter(1 for meat, 1 for sides, and one for $) so don't expect the line to move quickly.\n\nSo if you don't mind blowing a few hours of your afternoon waiting in line at a little hole in the wall bbq restaurant by the airport while you question your sanity, this is the place for you.", "stars": 5}

We decided that purchasing some authentic turquoise jewelry would be the perfect gift.  We wanted to make sure that it was authentic and preferably made by Native Americans.   I did more research and discovered that reputable merchants would provide the artists name and tribe.  I also learned that some merchants try to pass  off, less expensive dyed stones as real turquoise.  Luckily,  I was able to locate the Silver Post, a family owned local business with over 40 Native American artists.   We were greeted right away by a friendly  salesgirl.  Upon having the first piece pulled out for viewing the salesperson volunteered the artists name and tribe and showed us the signature marking of the piece.  I knew we were off to a good start.  We selected a beautiful necklace and earring set along with a music CD .   Personallly I have never worn turquoise, but I am definately planning a future purchase of my own as this was some of the prettiest that I have ever seen.  We were wrapping up the sale when the owner came out and introduced himself.   He gave us a tour of the store and told us about many of the artists that he works with from various tribes, Navajo, Creek etc.   We learned about white buffalo turquoise, horse hair pottery and were shown a whole wall of indian artifacts.  He explained that he does his best to purchase American made products which is also great in my opinion.  We left feeling like we had toured an art gallery instead of the usual holiday hustle.

The service is spot-on, the food is always consistently excellent, and the naan is always free with the buffet. Their curried goat or lamb are my favourites, but nearly everything is so tasty I'm usually tempted to try the veg dishes as well.

{"text": "I wrote a long review on The Prime, but somehow, it didn't get published, so I'm going to write again, but a much shorter version.  My family all loves this place and we've been going here for many years.  In a nutshell, you get really good, like gourmet Chinese food because they have Filet Mignon in the Hawaiian Beef and all white meat chicken in the Sweet & Sour Chicken.  The egg rolls are good, but not as big as some and the portions and price aren't as good as they were before the light rail put many people out of business, but yet, they survived.  The menu is smaller, prices are a bit higher, and the portions are a bit smaller, but we haven't found any better food in Phoenix.  Jenny the owner usually waits on the tables and her husband cooks in the kitchen.  if we need to hurry, we let her know, otherwise, we go for a relaxing meal with the clean and modern looking place that it is inside.  We had our food to go recently for the first time and that was great, too.  She always makes my 3 yr. old feel special, which is really nice.", "stars": 5}
{"text": "My husband and I flew with Kevin and his crew yesterday on the sunset flight.  It was our anniversary and they all made it so special. It was my third time in a balloon and my husband's first time.  By far, this was my best experience. I appreciate Kevin's expertise (year's of piloting and training of other pilots) and the fact that he cares about his passengers' experience.  He takes the time to point out the beauty of the area and shows you as much as possible during the flight. He got us close to the mountains so that we could see wildlife. We were fortunate to have a private flight (no one else booked the same time as our flight).  One of the things that I liked about Kevin is the fact that he likes smaller groups (2-4 people plus him) for his flights. My first experience (with a different company) had the potential of having 11 other people with me.  Kevin and his crew were all so personable throughout.  I would fly with them again in a heartbeat.  Be sure to bring your camera because you will see some gorgeous scenery!!!", "stars": 5}

Dishes are elegant, playful (see: \"adult\" grilled cheese), genuinely delicious, and in keeping with the a-la-mode theme, accompanied by some decadent chaser of asiago mashed potatoes, creamy beef salad, or the classic ice cream in the case of their stellar desserts.\n\nThe check (a scandalous bargain) is delivered, adorably, in the flyleaf of a vintage book.

We could very well critique things that went wrong, but there were too many great tasting things that outweighed the negative. I highly recommend this location, as you can also expect friendly faces, and gorgeous ambience. These guys are doing it right. We are so glad we came here, great job!", "stars": 5}

If you're looking for upscale gourmet food, perhaps go somewhere else. But if you're looking to fill the hunger gap at a low price AND get your moneys worth then come on down! Dry chili chicken/beef, Special chicken, Satay chicken, Hakka chow mein, are all great choices. My favorite is their crispy beef. Really spicy, sweet, crispy. With steamed rice so not to mess with the flavour, yes please.", "stars": 5}

Nope - local beer on tap or a mimosa drink of the day... um, yes please! :)  They are so thorough in the education of their clients about hair and are obviously passionate about what they do.  They give you a menu of the wash house experience you prefer and are escorted to a dimly lit and relaxing room for a shampoo and awesome scalp massage.  My haircut and style were great and Ashley was fun to talk with.  On the way out Kyle walked me to my car covered with an umbrella because it was drizzling.  He literally wouldn't leave until my door was closed so I didn't get a raindrop on my hair.  I can not say enough about this place and the wonderful people who work there.

I absolutely have never had any ginger sauce this good.  They added some unusual items, like cubes potatoes and eggplant, to the stir-fry.  Surprisingly, it worked! \n\nThe portions were generous and prices are really reasonable.  You get so much food for the money.  I enjoyed the atmosphere--very classy.

I decided to give it one last try, and man I was so glad that I did!\nUpon walking in my husband and I were greeted by the owner Ivan. Ivan was very kind and helpful, and he was not pushy like the other stores that I have been in(which I absolutely hate, especially when they follow you around). He told me to feel free to browse and gave me the space that I needed to check out his merchandise. Finally out of nowhere, there it was, on a rack hanging, the exact shawl that I have been dreaming of! The price was reasonable, and he even calculated the price in US dollars so I could have a better idea. I made the purchase right away, and I was so happy that I could get my dream shawl at such a reasonable price!\nI would definitely recommend Dubarry to anyone that's looking for high quality, reasonably priced fur products. Ivan is genuine and helpful, and he will treat you like family when you are here. Can't wait to go back again on our next trip to Montreal!", "stars": 5}

{"text": "So this is my first Yelp review and I NEVER write Yelp reviews, but this business deserves special recognition. I looked around for car audio shops to fix the alarm system on my car and found this one on yelp with 5 stars with about 15 reviews. I was skeptical since I thought maybe they were fake accounts made to boost their ratings to draw more customers. Very pessimistic thinking, I know, but whatever I decided to give this place a shot.\n\nThe problem with my car alarm was that it would go off at random times and I needed this to stop for obvious reasons. Called at 8am when they opened and they scheduled me for a 10am appointment. The guy that answered didn't ask for my name, but remembered I called about a car alarm when I arrived. I wasn't helped right away since a lot of the staff was busy running around, but made it a point to tell me they will be with me as soon as possible. Plus I think it was the owner that came up to me personally and asked the staff if I had been helped, which he did with all other customers that came in. After waiting about 5-10 minutes I was helped and they brought my car into their garage. They worked on it and after a short period they came to tell me that my alarm was dysfunctional but could disengage it so it wouldn't go off at random intervals. They cut the wires to disengage the system and told me that I still will be able to use my remote key lock/unlock to get into my car, but it won't make a horn noise or flash the lights to notify the car is locked. I was fine with this since it was a temporary fix to my problem, but I still need to get a new alarm system. The owner of the shop ran through the many options they offer and mentioned there was a lifetime warranty on all of the alarms they installed except 1. I thanked him for being honest and upfront with me and told him I would need to think about what alarm I would want since I didn't want to drop $200-$300 that day.\n\nAfter I got my car back I asked him how much I owed. He said the service was complementary and I was shocked. I got my problem fixed for free. I am so amazed at how nice, courteous, and genuine these guys are for fixing my problem for free. Granted they just cut a few wires to disengage an alarm was a lot nicer than some other shops that would have charged me $40 some dollars to do the same thing. I am very impressed by this business and will be looking to go to them if I need any custom work done to my car. 5+ stars and would absolutely go again!", "stars": 5}

{"text": "I purchased my 2016 Nissan Versa Note Sv about two months ago after my car died. My dad, who likes to deal with things automotive, did some scouting of dealerships. Being that it was my first official car purchase that I would have to finance I was pretty set on a few things. I wanted a 2013+ hatchback that was more economical than flashy and around 10,000 and wasn't silver (I know the second part is little ridiculous, but really didn't want a silver car). The other dealerships were quoting me above 10,000 for 2013 hatchbacks with 70,000+ miles on them. Things were looking bleak but after my dad went here he said they had exactly what I was looking for! He said I would most likely like the Nissan or the Chevys they had on the lot both were non-silver 2016 hatchbacks that were right around 35,000 miles at 9,000. My jaw dropped because both cars were in great shape and they had so many options! When I arrived we were greeted right away! All the salesmen were professional, knowledable and treated me with the utmost respect. My dad and I had a plan for me to finance through my bank but we didn't realize they didn't accept cash or credit card so we fumbled around like a couple of amateurs but ultimately decided to have Hertz finance it. We ended up staying late because there was an accident that happened on the lot but the salesmen despite them probably wanting to go home showed no signs of rushing or trying to cut corners. They gave us great service from start to finish! I ended up purchasing my Nissan there with the extended insurance. I loved their no haggle prices (even tho dad is a haggler, sorry guys) because it made things quick and easy for me. The following month I recommended this place to my friend who was in a car accident and needed a car! She too purchased her vehicle here (Sonata) within a two day time span! She had the same great experience here! I was so stressed and a big ball of emotions when my car died and the thought of having a new car loan and having to go deal with buying a car made everything worst!

When I got to the dealership it was really busy, but understandable, I was helped as soon as someone was available. They had me wait in the lobby, which was warm, clean, entertaining and accommodating if you have work to do. Maurice quoted me an hour or an hour and a half.

The Doctor was very thorough in everything he did, explained things so even someone with low blood sugar can understand. I have dealt with many Doctors over the 23 years of being a diabetic, very few make sure you understand everything that is going on before you leave. \nI can't speak to the costs or quality of the products they offer because I have to go back to get glasses today.\n\n I would like to thank everyone at Progressive Eyecare for helping me through that day.", "stars": 5}

The young woman helping me was extremely knowledgeable and patiently explained everything clearly while answering my many questions.

The other customers received the same attention I was being given and in the same courteous manner.\n \nOnce my tanning package was nailed down and my new tanning lotion was purchased, I was escorted back to the tanning bed and given clear and detailed instructions on its use. I was really impressed with the cleanliness of the beds and how many they had. In fact, every time I come in (which is 4 to 5 times a week on my lunch break) the beds are always clean and I never have to wait. The ladies always make sure to greet me when I arrive and tell me to have a good day when I go. Little things like that can really make a place stand out to me. \n\nThe prices are great.

Some of my white friends (and my white husband) complain about the atmosphere (or lack thereof) and quite honestly they complain about the dubious cleanliness too. But, if you know Vietnamese restaurants, and authentic Asian restaurants in general, then this is no surprise for you. Sure, the old Taco Bell ambience leaves a little to be desired, but damn - that's good pho. Also, considering that half of the cleaner looking pho places these same friends enjoy have been shut down for health code violations, and this place proudly displays their gold stickers on the wall, I feel pretty safe here.

{"text": "Rivertowne Pourhouse is certainly a favorite bar/restaurant of mine. When Rivertowne Pourhouse (formerly Parkway Tavern for you townies) opened a few years ago, it already had a large following of former Gateway students grandfathered in.\n\nSo let me start with the good about this place. [Pretty much] everything. A lot of employees have been friends of mine, the food is always incredibly delicious, the drinks are served promptly. I mention the employee point to illustrate that this is truly a local establishment which emphasizes a \"community first\" attitude. You will get reliable service, well prepared meals, and some of the best home brewed beer in Pittsburgh. The trifecta.\n\nI've never had a meal here that's disappointed me. There's always half off appetizers too, every day, 10p-midnight. So if you want a late snack, you can get a hefty portion of cheese fries or breaded zucchini for a very competitive price. Drink prices for the amazing brews are reasonable too. For $3 during happy hour (excluding high gravity) you can try one of the ever changing list of carefully crafted beers. At the end of the night too feel free to buy a 6-pack of select favorites, and maybe you'll find a new go-to for your next trip. There's a beer here for every taste and preference.\n\nRivertowne will mostly deliver an enjoyable time out also. The weekends can get packed, the weekdays are good for just having a drink in a relaxed environment.\n\nWhich I guess brings me to my only gripe. Being a big fan of the Pourhouse for years, I will say that I avoid Saturdays anymore. Not because of the establishment whatsoever, but because of the weekend DJs and some of the embarrassment that accompanies them.\n\nNow, I used to enjoy seeing it at first because yes, it absolutely is hysterical to watch 40-50 year old mothers clumsily dancing on... well, the space between tables since there isn't actually a dance floor. But that mixed with some of the younglings who can't handle themselves and the deafening volume of the DJ, the Saturday night visits have become a little less than desirable. Read recent reviews and you'll see that the decibels put out by the DJ are no exaggeration. Its a shame because the weekend DJs are actually very energetic, but having fun does not require one's ears to bleed.\n\nThat being said however, if you are looking for an enjoyable night out with family and friends for quality food and beer, you really can't beat Rivertowne Pourhouse in Monroeville. This a fantastic place to frequent, just don't bring grandma past 9:00pm on a Saturday night.", "stars": 5}
{"text": "I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised with the Cinemark theater in Monroeville, considering if you're from this area you know what a train wreck our poor mall has become in recent years. But Cinemark is superb.\n\nFirst off, Cinemark's popcorn is where it's at. Hands down the best theater popcorn you'll get, and you can drench it in butter and salt which makes it even more delicious. The prices are what you'd expect from any cinema, so don't be shocked to see $3 Snow Caps. Cinemark does have a free downloadable app however, where each movie you see, you earn rewards for your next movie. (Free Icee's!)\n\nThe theaters themselves are incredibly clean. The seating is phenomenal and more comfortable than any other theater in the area, and the quality of the screens is crisp and brand new. I've been here a few times already and have yet to experience any sound or picture issues. Every seat has an equally amazing view as well. No more straining of the neck if you get exiled to the front row.\n\nThe only con is that since the theater is connected to the mall, the weekend showings may draw in a higher-than-average number of talkative 14-year old brats (since they get bored aimlessly wandering the mall). I will say though for the first time in my life, theater staff *actually* kicked these kids out after checking in and hearing the kids talking loudly. So kudos to the staff for caring and being awesome.\n\nIf you're looking to catch a movie though, this is the place to go. Cinemark Monroeville has actually brought me out of \"movie-going retirement\" and made catching a flick in Pittsburgh an enjoyable experience again.", "stars": 5}
{"text": "If you've ever wondered what there is to do around the city that doesn't involve dodging drunks with your car in the South Side, I implore you: check out Paint Monkey.\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to do something that wasn't just a cliche date for Valentine's Day this past February. We had heard of Paint Monkey and wanted to go, so we decided what better time to buy two tickets? What a brilliant decision.\n\nFirst things first, the owners Joe and Mary Lou are awesome and incredibly helpful and friendly. There is zero pressure or intimidation here that you might expect if art isn't your forte. You walk into the beautiful, spacious studio with your bottle of wine or handle of rum (yes, it is BYOB and no, nobody's judging you), mingle with the other smart people who bought tickets, and enjoy the iPod being played throughout the studio (the playlist which I can only imagine being titled \"the best music ever made\").\n\nThe entire experience and premise of Paint Monkey is enjoyable. You get a group of family/friends together, have some drinks, and paint. Speaking of which, let me tell you a little about the painting. It doesn't matter if you screw up paint-by-numbers pictures, Paint Monkey will awaken your artistic spirit and completely surprise even the most inept artistes. \n\nThe canvases are all pre-drawn with what you'll be creating that day, so essentially the hard part is already out of the way. Which means you can now focus on enjoying yourself completely and releasing your creative side in order to make your painting \"you\". Out of a class of maybe 14 with the same exact stencil, not one painting (adorable love birds in a tree) came out the same. After you're done, Joe takes photos of your masterpieces and uploads them to their Facebook page, which is a simple yet really cool idea. And the best part is you take your painting home and can even frame them if you want. These are not 8x11's either from a day camp. These beauties can easily hang in your living room (or cellar, depending on your results).\n\nWhy is this important for me to mention? Because 1.) People with zero artistic ability should not be frightened off, and 2.) There's no limit or end to the amount of fun you can have at Paint Monkey. Just keep in mind that you will need to view the schedule on their website, and you must purchase tickets beforehand. Ticket prices run about $35 or higher each. You've got to consider what you get out of this experience though, and you'll see it's worth every penny.\n\nWe personally can't wait to come back, and this time bring friends and introduce them to one of Pittsburgh's best hidden gems!", "stars": 5}

I'm ecstatic that Noodles & Company found it's way to Monroeville though, and they certainly don't disappoint.\n\nThe whole concept of the place is pretty cool. It's sort of fast food, sort of restaurant. This location is clean and bright on the inside. You have the options to dine-in or take out, and the wait is only around 5-10 minutes. Another great option is they offer beer, or you can use the cool Coke machines. I know a lot of people like those, but personally I'm not a huge fan. It's basically various watered down flavors that mix together to create your desired concoction.\n\nThe Japanese Pan Noodle with marinated steak is the best item on the menu if you ask me. Piping hot, fresh, and the texture is unique and delicious. I have yet to receive an order that disappointed. My friends and I used to go to Noodles & Co. all the time for lunches while attending the police academy, and every time we went we enjoyed a flavorful meal.\n\nGreat establishment that will serve you quality food at reasonable prices when you need an impromptu dinner or a quick lunch.", "stars": 5}

I was dissapointed that there were no more red velvet cupcakes left, but she recommended the chocolate cheesecake cupcake. I was a bit iffy because I'm not that fond of too much chocolate, but decided to go with her suggestion anyways. \n\nLet me tell you...I did not have high expectations because as I said before, I have been dissapointed with every cupcake in the city I tried. \n\nEven though the store was just about to close, the cupcake tasted so fresh and moist. It was not overly sweet and ohhh, the icing. The chocolate cream cheese frosting was so lucious!!! I fell in love! \n\nYes, I guess some people might consider the price of the cupcakes to be on the pricey side, but hey, it is so worth it for me.

Also, from what I've seen, they don't have any games in poor condition, which is a plus for collectors.  The prices are also very competitive.

I have had a few terrible experiences with dentists straight up lying to my face about procedures I needed done, the state of my general oral health, etc., and because of those experiences, I have an inherent distrust of all dentists.\n\nThat said, I think Dr. Quinn is a fantastic dentist. I've had a wisdom tooth removed and two fillings done here, and both times, I felt nothing - not even the novocaine, which, to be honest, I didn't think was possible. The recovery after the tooth extraction was easy too - I was up walking around by 3pm that day, and didn't even need to keep the gauze in. He knows what he's doing. \n\nDid I mention I don't even live in the area? I live in Los Angeles, and I make special trips here for dental procedures because I'm crazy and paranoid and I only trust one dentist. \n\nSeriously, best dentist of all time.", "stars": 5}

The interior looked very clean and well maintained.  Far beyond half the the food places I usually go to.  It's cozy, but not too overwhelming like a lot of the coffee shops.  I could see myself spending an hour or more here (maybe I will next time I come). The service was nice, promt, and most importantly, felt very personal.\n\nI had ordered a croissant Tijuana sandwich and their famous Poutine.  Was very impressed with how it looked: usually food doesn't look as good as the advertisement, but this looked better!  See how the cheese stretched? While the Tijuana satisfied me, I'll be looking to try another sandwich next time.  It's still one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten, but it was just a little too well blended for me:  the first bite tasted exactly the same as the last.  Very good as comfort food, but not very...exciting.  \n\nThe poutine, though!  Everything the reviews said and more!  I'll admit, I had doubts and deliberated a long time before choosing to order it.  Who wants limp fries instead of crispy ones? Well, the potato skins more than make up for the lack of crispiness. And, the cheese and gravy on top adds much more flavor than mere salt.  Plus, the texture is amazing!  You don't really feel like you're eating fries, really.  I really don't know what else to say to describe how wonderful this dish is. And it looks so very tasty!This Poutine is a \"must order\"...although you might want to order it by itself instead of with a sandwich like me.

Each dish has its own flavor and flair.  \n\nBut what stood out to me the most was the service.  I've been here thrice for dinner, and have had three different waiters/waitresses serve.  They were all very attentive, very personable, and had this way of making you feel special.  Whatever training they give their employees must be amazing. Frankly, I've never received nearly as much satisfaction I got from the service here.

We flew in, met Randy and Jerrod, got an estimate, picked our finishes and hired them for the job.  We hired Lollis to tear out all the flooring and install new tile and carpet, cut down our kitchen island to 1 level and extend the size of the counter, paint all cabinets in the house (kitchen, bathrooms and laundry), install window trim and crown molding, install new 5+\" molding in entire house, install new quartz counter tops, do 1 wall of shiplap in the livingroom, build and install barn doors in the livingroom, install all new lighting and ceiling fans throughout the house, install a water filtration system and paint the entire interior of the house (including ceilings).  The entire time the remodel was happening we were still living in CO.  Lollis is extremely trustworthy and we had no issue turning over the keys to our home to them.  They kept in constant contact, sent pictures and updates regularly and checked in with us at each step of the remodel to ensure we were all in the loop on everything happening.  We didn't see the remodeled home until the day we arrived with the moving truck to move in.  I was almost in tears when I saw the home.  The work they did was beyond astonishing.  Everything was absolutely perfect.  To say they are perfectionists is almost an understatement.  Everything they did was above and beyond our expectations.  There was not 1 item in the entire home that we had to have them come fix or redo.  Not one.  It was all done flawlessly.  They made what could have been a nightmare and difficult remodel into a dream come true for us.  They are a pleasure to work with and the most upstanding, skilled and trustworthy company.  After moving in we hired them to do a quick install of a 2nd fence/gate on our property to help keep our dogs from escaping every time someone came by and opened the main fence gate.  We also had them install our doggie door.  All of this was done with superb quality and attention to detail.  Their pricing was very fair and the quality of products was outstanding.

First off from the time I entered the dealership I was treated with something refreshing. RESPECT. I had tried to collect information on a vehicle I was interested in (Evolution GSR) at the other Mitsubishi dealership in town on Barlow Trail a few days prior to making a trip to the guys at Hyatt but no one was willing to speak with me. I felt as though no one was taking me seriously. I had to speak with the receptionist at Platinum before a salesperson decided to walk over to me. I felt as though I was being judged maybe as being too young to possibly afford the vehicle? Upon asking for a test drive I was denied. With the reasoning that there were no demo models currently available even though I could clearly see a few of the vehicles sitting outside, and reschedule when it wasn't so busy? Needlessly to say I left their Dealership and went to Hyatt a few days later. Once in the dealership I was greeted by a nice gentlemen Matthew. He asked me if I was interested in a beverage right off the bat and made me feel very comfortable with the process. His knowledge on the vehicle was very helpful, and his demeanor was very caring. Even before I decided to purchase the vehicle he gave me a tour of the dealership and also an idea of the services available. It was the entire package that made me decide to go with Hyatt, and Mitsubishi in general. I never felt uncomfortable, or pressured into the sale. Everything just felt right. I absolutely LOVE my new car. Thanks Matthew! and Thanks Hyatt! I definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new vehicle!\n\nJonathan", "stars": 5}

On my trip to Vegas, we decided to eat at this particular restaurant because it was relatively close to where we were staying at and we wanted to try French food that didn't cost an arm and a leg. We stopped in on the Saturday lunch rush, and the wait wasn't too long. The hostess was very friendly and courteous. We requested to sit out near the patio, where it was nice and sunny, yet air-conditioned and hostess had no problem with that request. \n\nFor the appetizer my girlfriend and I ordered the escargot bourguignon and we decided to order some bloody marys that we could make at the bloody mary bar. The appetizers came in a timely fashion with a baguette. My girlfriend was kind of worried about eating snails because she has never had them before, but I told her that she wouldn't be disappointed. When the snails came out, the presentation was OK. I guess it was standard for that particular style of escargot. The snails were buttery, which is a good thing in my opinion! The basil sauce each snail came with was superb, perfect for dipping part of the bread into. The bloody marys consisted of top shelf alcohol, which we requested, and we were free to put whatever we wanted, which is expected at a do-it-yourself bloody mary bar. I wish it was an all you can drink bloody mary bar, but one can only wish... It was very good none-the less!\n\nOur entrees consisted of the mussels and gazpacho. The mussels were definitely good. The mussels were cooked perfectly, not rubbery or gritty that some lower end places tend to serve. The mussels were cooked in white wine and garlic, which is like pretty standard for mussels, but they where very large and meaty. What was especially good was that the white wine sauce tasted very good with the baguette that we got at the beginning of our lunch.\n\nFor Vegas, the food was very reasonably priced, even with the top shelf alcohol bloody mary bar. This place was much better than the overpriced MGM Grand Buffet that barely passes at edible!", "stars": 5}

{"text": "Totally different experience.\nMy fiancee' and I spent two weeks driving every small SUV in our price range in the Valley. When we weren't being held hostage by over-zealous sales managers, we were being pandered to by salesmen who seemed to pigeon-hole us into bigger cars that we didn't want (or, more likely, they had directives by their bosses to push). No one seemed to listen to our very particular requests, and we felt challenged just getting off of those lots from the high-pressure sales staff.\n\nIt was such a pleasant change of pace meeting Bill after responding to the dealership's Internet ads. He took us directly to the car we inquired about and let us take our time to kick the tires. There were no invasive questions about financing -- we did not dress the part, but no one questioned our ability to purchase a car or pushed for a less-expensive option. The negotiation was more of a discussion, absent any passive-aggressive sales tactics we had encountered at other places. Bill spoke plainly and there weren't any tactical visits from the sales manager. Two enthusiastic thumbs up for Coulter Cadillac dealer and Bill Jurczak. Their professionalism and old-fashioned straight talk wins the day.\n\nOur SRX feels powerful when we drive it and butter when we sit in the seats -- the buying experience only enhanced our satisfaction when we drive it there is no tainting from a bad buying experience.

The sauce was excellent as was the macaroni salad and bbq beans we had on the side. 15 chicken wings completed the meal which was their special for $25.

We had chorizo, carnitas, and asada. All were very good but our favorite was the chorizo. Corn on the cob with mayo, cheese and chile is the only way to it and for $2 each we had two. Out of all the Mexican places we've ate at around town this one has the best salsa bar. There were at least 7 to choose from and there were grilled peppers and onions both hot and cold.

{"text": "I have worked with Staffing Agencies in the past, and I as I was looking to relocate to the Phoenix area, I chose to work with them again. However, before I could look them up, I was contacted by All About People agent, Alexandria Gillming. Due to having found my Resume on Indeed, she reached out to me, and thus began my A+ experience with her and All About People. \n\nWhen I arrived at the office for my interview, I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by an updated, modern, clean, and inviting building, both on the exterior and the interior. The receptionist, Ethy, went above and beyond to make sure that I had a comfortable experience. Once she'd greeted me, she kept me updated on the activities of my interviewer (both Alex, and the owner, Sherri Mitchell), ensuring that I never felt forgotten about or frustrated. She was extremely kind, and pleasant to talk to. \n\nUpon being ushered into the interview area by Ms. Gillming, I once again felt comfortable in the environment. Local art adorns the walls, and the air felt fresh and clean. After speaking with Ms. Gillming, and discussing my skills and job preferences, it quickly became obvious that she believed in me, and my abilities. She began to discuss with me a position that she believed me capable of even though I don't possess a background in that particular industry. When I left the interview, I left holding my head high, encouraged by the feeling of being believed in, smiled at, and valued. I had shaken hands with a professional \"encourager\", who is otherwise known as a Recruiter. \n\nA few days later, I arrived for another interview. This time my interview was conducted by the owner, Sherri Mitchell. After spending time with her, it became quickly apparent to me that possesses a zest for people, passion for her job, and the strong qualities needed to succeed. She handled our interview with finesse, and also left me feeling encouraged and supported. \n\nAlthough my relocation plans have changed, I was given great customer service through to the very last moment. I would never hesitate to work with the staff in Phoenix, and look forward to someday being in the same location as another All About People. \n\n(All About People has 16 locations throughout the States, and is continuing to open more. So don't despair if you don't live near the Phoenix location!)", "stars": 5}

I bought 4 dozen donut holes and a dozen (8 glazed/4 maple bars). I am a simple donut girl who loves her maple bars and glazed almost exclusively. The total was only $14 I think!! Super affordable and worth every penny (not including tip).\n\nLastly, the owners are SOOO AMAAAZING and sweet! \"Mrs. Ronald\" went out of her way to make sure I was well stocked on my way out.

I recently did the Big Chop  (BC) and really wanted a protective style while I grew accustomed to my new hair. I had about 6 months of natural hair and the desire for a new style just 1.5 weeks after the BC. \n\nI decided to get box braids in the shape of a bob. I've never had this short of hair (other than the BC), but wanted something that would be low-maintenance for work (military). It took about 6hrs in total to braid and shape/seal ends, and it was sooo worth it. I cannot believe how excellent the shape is and how neat the braids are. I am so impressed! I have never had so many compliments on new hair EVER! I'm actually loving my new short 'do, and think that this style will really help me transition with the short length of my current natural hair. \n\nOne more thing to add: Jai took me on her day off! At the time, I didn't know it was her day off, but she knew how badly I wanted her to braid my hair on such a short notice for the 4th of July weekend. \n\nI have found my braid lady! \n\nThanks, again Jai!

Otherwise it comes free with toast, pancakes or muffin I think \nFried steak is totally crispy outside and moist inside \nI chose over easy eggs with it \nFrench toast done perfectly ..unlike most restaurants they bathed the heck out of the toast in eggs these are done perfecto!!! \nTheres also a car wash service while you eat lol!

All great except this is the only one that sticks around...so guess that speaks a lot in itself? \nI'm kinda \"consistent\" when it comes to this restaurant...I order the same few dishes every time...the waitress knows my order but still hands me a menu ...good 4 her :) \n\nWell here are my rating by stars\nAPPETIZERS: \nRoti Canai 5* (small order, get two or three if entr\u00e9e)\nCurry Puffs 4* (potatoes fillings exc flavor, pastry not too bad)\nIce Kacang 5* (my fav, Malaysian style shaved ice ...must try :)\n\nIf you like to feel exotic, get the young coconut drink. Its served straight out of the coconut itself. You will love very exotic ;)\n\nENTREE: \nChar Kuey Teow 5* ( ask for sambal belacan (stinky chili sauce ;) yummmm\n\nHokkein Char Mee 3-4*  (fat noodles, like udon size fried in black sauce. Its very yummy f the cook gets to heat his wok extra hot. Same for char kuey teow abv)\n\nMee Goreng 4* (this is Indian Fried Noodles...back home is fried with some ketchup)\n\nKari Ayam 5* (= malaysian chicken curry. This is the same curry served with Roti Canai) \n\nAnything with Belacan is good if you like the flavor of belacan. But I think just like Durian, belacan is an acquired taste. Its basically chili paste mix with dried shrimp paste. The Thai also use it in their dish. In Malaysia, we eat everything with it. Just as we would ask for ketchup, hot sauce or mayo here, we would ask for belacan to go with most of the dishes @ home. \n\nNOTE: They DONT take credit card --so go to your ATM first.  \n\nI LOVE ISLAND MALAYSIAN ....this is one place I visit at least once or every two months for the past few years since they opened.", "stars": 5}

I won't gas on about both experiences, but I'll tell you what made the difference this morning.  \n\nI waved a couple customers ahead of me, because I was unsure of what I wanted and I thought I might be a little longer at the register.  When I stepped up and after ordering a bunch of bagels and cream cheese for the office, the young gentleman behind the counter asked me if I wanted any coffee or juice.  I said, \"No thanks, they can get their own coffee and juice.\"   His reply? \"I wasn't worried about them.  I was worried about you.\"\n\nHospitality.  That's what it was.  100% sincere and easy as pie.  More places should do it.  It takes but a few words to make a connection with a customer and win loyalty.  A little bit of loyalty goes a long, long way. \n\nIt only got better when he shouted out to the customers, \"Who's parked out front?!?!\"  I turn to see the parking enforcement man circling my car with a catlike grin on his face, rubbing his hands together greedily.

Also the pan fried mackerel is more authentic and less greasy. If you love Korean style Jajang myun and jampong, this place makes them pretty authentic. I can't find it like this even in Dallas, TX. \n\nOverall,  I love this restaurant.", "stars": 5}
{"text": "Even though I lived out in Bloomfield, I chose to drive out to this vet because I'd heard good reviews about Dr. Dorn's handling of rats and other small exotic breeds. I had two rats and Dr. Dorn was excellent with both. He was the best vet I could have hoped for. \n\nWith rats, it's sometimes hard to find (even highly experienced) vets who understand that a rat has a personality and bonds with its owner to the same degree as a dog--many people act like pet rats are just large gerbils. Dr. Dorn understood, and never made me feel silly about being anxious about them. He calmed my pets down and they loved him immediately, even falling asleep during the exam. He never tried to up-sell, and when one rat had an operable tumor (a $200 surgery) he didn't make me feel guilty for choosing euthanasia instead (he was a very old rat). When the time came, the entire staff was incredibly patient with me, and let me spend as much time as I needed in the private exam room with my rat. Afterwards, they even sent me a condolence card. \n\nThe vet techs were all professional and cheerful. The small office seemed like a friendly, casual environment. Exams for a rat were around $60 with medicine and so forth... I can't remember the specific prices, but they seemed reasonable. They were always able to see me on the same day I called. If I hadn't moved out of town, I would certainly still be making the lengthy drive from Bloomfield to get here--it was worth it.", "stars": 5}

It was hard choosing our favourite from all the beautiful stationary they provide but we ended up going with a foil stamped Smock collection. I didn't anticipate purchasing so much stationary but it was all so gorgeous I couldn't help myself! I developed a paper addiction. We also received countless compliments from guests on how classy, sophisticated, and beautiful the stationary was.\n\nSam Kanter was a real joy to work with. We truly benefitted from someone who has been in the business so long, who has seen trends come and gone, and can give time-proven advice. Given that we were going for a timeless classic look, Sam provided great tips both in terms of aesthetics as well as great cost-saving tips. Things like, one-ply vs. two-ply paper, purchasing envelopes separately, and when to use foil or just regular inked letterpress. To save costs they can also print their own stationary in-house. Their graphic designer, Kevin, created great designs for the accommodation card and reply envelope, which blended seamlessly with Smock's suite and saved us a ton of money.\n\nTheir rates were very reasonable, comparable to any of the stationary shops in the city, and is truly one of the best. They are neither snobby or pretentious. We felt very comfortable and at home there.\n\nTheir turn around time was very quick, and they were very easy to get ahold of and accommodating. For example, we were able to pick up stationary after hours, never had to make an appointment or wait, and Arna was very responsive to emails.\n\nOverall, besides my husband and wedding dress, choosing Paper Ideas for our stationary was one of the best wedding decisions we made.", "stars": 5}

This was a bit tough since I'd be ordering the minis. Cupid's has a wide range of cupcakes available and are very flexible with which cupcakes they offer (e.g., cupcakes made Friday and Saturday for a Saturday wedding, plus brides can request the flavour of the day). They were also very flexible about when I could come in for a meeting, modifying the colour of the icing (I wanted all white/off-white), payment, and did a beautiful job delivering and arranging the cupcakes.

This is the place you dream about buying your dress at. Everything is so beautiful, you can see their put a lot of pride and thought into their business. Beautiful white flowing wedding dresses are everywhere, as are fresh flowers, and other fabulously girly things. \n\nFirst, you can book your appointment via email. Any company with online booking is a star in my books. Then you and your guests are whisked upstairs to a beautiful room all to yourself. There is seating for guests and a partition behind which the bride can change in privacy. For the duration of your appointment, you're the bridal consultant's only client. It's a very individual, intimate experience.\n\nThen you try on the gowns! They have a huge selection of wedding gowns at an even wider range of prices. I never felt uncomfortable because i was at a lower price point. They truly have a beautiful selection of gowns from the best designers, like Carolina Herrara, Oscar de la Renta, Monique Lhuillier, Reem Acra, and Jenny Packham. I personally went there for Jenny Packham. They are one of the only salons to carry Jenny Packham in the region, and I personally found Powder to have shoddy customer service- so i went to White!\n\nMy consultant was Tamara and I worked with her for every appointment I had. She was very personable, honest, and helpful. I didn't always bring bridesmaids or family, and she truly felt like a friend when I was alone.\n\nI ended up buying with Jenny Packham's Joy. When you buy a dress you get champagne and other goodies. I received so many compliments on my wedding dress- it was the talk of the night. Everyone kept commenting on how glamorous and unique it was. Not the strapless a-line or fit-n-flare everyone and their sister wears.\n\nThe dress arrived very quickly, and they let me know as soon as it arrived. I also had alterations done at White Toronto. Given the amount of beading on my dress, I figured they'd know how to alter it best. The seamstress did an outstanding job. She picked up on all my little body eccentricities without me having to mention them, and altered it flawlessly.\n\nWhite Toronto further has anything a bride needs. I needed a backless adhesive bra and couldn't find the gel version anywhere in the city. They had it and even showed me how to put it on properly. they also sell crazy things like covers for stilettos so your heel won't sink into the ground if you walk on grass and seamless undies.\n\nFinally, they did a wonderful job packaging my dress. They did so such that my dress had no wrinkles the day of. They also helped me get my dress in my coupe- which is no easy feat.\n\nOverall, I couldn't have asked for a better wedding dress experience. This is one bridal salon you have to go to.", "stars": 5}

It's also great supporting local independently owned businesses. \n\nAndrew's Formals has all the suits they own in-house. As such, you can actually try something on the first time you go in. Further, they have a wide range of tuxedos and suits to rent. From traditional black, to navy, gray, charcoal, tan, white, and everything in between. Great if you're looking for something a bit different.\n\nThe rates are on par with other rental companies. Their tailoring was also impeccable.

He even vacuumed after himself.\n\nWhile at my house, Kevin noted the monitoring device from the company that monitored prior to my purchase of the house....u know the one, new system and 3 year contract.  He asked if I was going to use the equipment again, and I told him no and advised I almost threw it out.  He asked if he could credit some of his bill in exchange for the unit.  That way he could help another customer like me with existing system AND save us both money!  Yes sir, take it!\n\nOverall, I am ecstatic with what he did and have not had one more false alarm.  Kevin even followed up with me the next day to make sure all was working!  He did not try to sell me anything I did not need and we even discussed my monitoring with his company.  Once my current contract is up, I will certainly consider him.  If you need an alarm guy with you in mind, give Kevin a shout.", "stars": 5}

{"text": "Tim Finnegan's is outstanding! It is the most authentic Irish Pub in the valley, and in Arizona for that matter. It is operated and still somewhat based out of Ireland, by actually Irish, people. It has an authentic pub feel and ambiance, and is not overwhelmed with the color green, leprechauns, shamrocks and all that stereotypical, superficial and over romanticized \"Irish stuff\" that you find in most \"Irish pubs\" in the states. In fact, I've never seen any of these things here. If you're looking for a more ambient pub experience (which I like) I would go anytime time between opening and 7pm. After that it'll get a little more loud as any place selling tippling beverages would.\n\nThe food is fantastic. I've tried a plethora of things from their cod sliders, flat breads (it's essentially pizza) burgers, fish and chips, Shepherd's Pie and many others. I have not been disappointed with anything here. Their drink selection is what you will find in any Hibernian pub, and they poor the best pint of Guinness (properly poured, clean lines, and ACTUALLY in a Guinness glass) I have found out of the many pubs in the phoenix area.  They offer wide range of Draught Irish beers, and have rotating tap of local  & nationwide craft breweries, as well as an extensive bar with a plethora of Irish and Scottish Whiskies. They even serve Kilkenny Cream Ale, which is hard to find in most places around the states. I would suppose the only downside on the food is their dessert. It is very tasty, however a bit expensive for the portion size. I got the Guinness Brownie (or cake, can't remember), with ice cream and it was very delicious! However, it was small and $8, which is costly for a poor(ish) college student like me haha. \n\nOverall this place is a great, fun, budget friendly (but quality) place, with fun events such as trivia and kareokee (however you spell that), live bands, and amazing happy hour deals, like half off apps which are fantastically portioned and taste great, dollar off drafts, and $3 wells, EVERYDAY from 4-7pm and 10-2am. The service is usually great, and sometimes it's slow for your server to come, but it is entirely understandable because I know they get busy. I would recommend it to anyone who is look for an authentic Irish pub, or just in the mood for something different. Tim Finnegan's will always have mine and my friends business, and highly recommend your patronage as well!", "stars": 5}

Eventually I did order a delicious dessert, which was a bit on the pricey side for the size but dude, 1,000 games that you can play for the whole day for $5! I'm okay with a bit of price, considering you don't have to order anything at all\n\nThe guy who helped us (sadly I cannot remember what his name was) was very nice, laid back, and had plenty of recommendations for us. Like I said, he kept back, leaving us to our own devices when we wanted, and knew when we needed help and always helped us. \n\n\nOverall, I would totally recommend this place over and over.

There is a distinct absence of a drinks menu but hey,  it is easy to find lots of places in Toronto for a drink before or after dinner.

True to the name, the salad was fresh and light tasting even with late fall limited access to fruits and berries. The shrimp bruschetta was a definite highlight loaded with flavor and texture.  Presentation, if that's your thing, impresses as well, with all the courses artfully arranged...a definite contrast to the place mats! \n\nThe first course  definitely ramps up your interesting dinner. I had the maple glazed pork chop and, wow, this is the come hungry portion of the program. The chop was huge and beautifully prepared, the mixed vegetables were a great and true mix, bok choy, carrots, beets, peppers, asparagus and mashed potatoes, all perfectly executed. This is a real raft of flavours and textures (a common theme) that work very well together. And did I mention  that the chop was huge!

The rest of the kids section is a castle theme, complete with a draw bridge and tower to read in. They need to put more light to be able to really read, though.

The kids find the books pretty easily. There is a teen section but I did peek in and it looked pretty hip. I really love that the adult section it is done in a mission style, probably to nod to Frank Lloyd Wright's presence in the Valley. It looks old and traditional and that is rare in a new city like Phoenix.\n\nOther details: The parking is covered--a must in AZ. There are always nooks to hang out by yourself. The staff is very helpful. The check out is pretty easy with bar coding. They also have a good baby program for the really young kids. Great place to rent DVD's and save some money.

Being a younger couple, he had my boyfriend and I laughing pretty much every time he checked in on us, which was often. We waited only about 10 minutes for our food and received our check without pressure so that we could go to the front and pay whenever we are ready. As very fast eaters, we usually go out for the food not the experience. Not to put down the experience of ihop, but the main reason we go is the food and service.

After my shower I noticed my right forearm was getting muddy-looking and I didn't want to go to prom like that! I called the salon and she told me to come in and text the manager a picture. I got an instant response, saying it was probably a very dry patch in the skin that absorbs more color and she said the technician could fix it easily and provided more instructions on how to maintain specific to my skin. After that it never got splotchy and faded very evenly. Definitely recommend for airbrushing!

Would you like a complimentary drink while you wait?\" \n\nTo be honest it wasn't that long a wait (it's never a dull moment when you have a Smartphone!) but I said \"sure, what would you recommend?\" He said \"How about a Wellness drink?\" And I said, \"go for it!\" \n\nTheir Wellness drink is more of a juice than a smoothie and it's pretty darn good. Later I looked at the menu to see how much this complimentary drink normally costs - $7.50. That's not the cheapest drink around and yeah, lucky me, I got it comped, just because War Beard cares about his customers. \n\nI guess the point I want to make is that War Beard - whether he's the manager or owner - really knows the meaning of Customer Satisfaction.

One is a sweet lab who loves everyone, but the minute you put a leash on her, she seems to forget that she has any training at all.  The other dog is a mix who is terrified of men, plastic bags, sudden movements, rain, etc.   We have had a hard time boarding them because they require extra attention and often wouldn't receive it at other kennels.  We would get home to reports that our dogs had difficulty adjusting to the kennel and our dogs would be clawing the way out the door to get home while we were trying to pack up their stuff.\n\nI found Wiggles and Wags through a friend's recommendations.  I went to their facility and they gave me a tour.  The facility is beautiful!  The kennels are clean and were remarkably quiet!  The room even smelled fresh (which is amazing in a room full of dogs).  Best of all, play time was included without an added cost.\n\nThe staff wanted to do an introduction with the dogs first, to make sure they felt comfortable with my problem children.  Turns out there was nothing to worry about.  The extra attention they provided was all that my dogs needed.  Both dogs had a wonderful time and, although excited to see us when we returned, weren't clawing their way out of the building.  They even washed one of our dog beds since one of our dogs knocked the water bowl over and made a mess!  I couldn't have asked for better treatment.  They even helped me carry everything out to the car!  \n\nWiggles and Wags has an amazing and attentive staff.  I recently moved out of state and am looking for a new kennel.

While junior high students are teenagers who aren't always the kindest, faculty has been responsive and open to correcting issues as well as letting the kids work them out on their own when possible and appropriate. (Because problem solving and independence need to be taught outside the classroom, too.) We drive from one end of Gilbert to the other to get to MJHS and it's been worth it in every way. The honors teachers have all been terrific and I've watched my daughter go from bored to engaged seemingly overnight. We are so glad that we chose MJHS out of all of our other options.", "stars": 5}

No one got the right side order with their entrees. Wife's BLT must have been sitting for quite a while because it was cold. Two of the fish & chips orders must have been sitting with the BLT because the fish coating had gotten soggy. (People had come in after us and gone before us fed and watered). Have to say though  the food (ignoring the time it had sat before being served) was good, and was priced right. Good beer choices and prices. The manager was called so we could vent to him, but he never came, but he did take 15% off the bill. I would have given them 5 stars if the waiters had been more attentive and the food had not sat so long before being served. The wait staff seemed very busy doing nothing in particular - just running to a n fro.  (These waiters want $15.00/hour? Oh please!) Hopefully, we were there on a VERY bad night. They do deserve a second try, which we will do in the near future.\n\nOK, so I said I would give this place another chance. Our first visit was only rated as a 2 star.

When I called DC Ranch, the receptionist asked the doctor, who inquired about the general condition of the dog.  They had the tech drive to my parents' house with a stretcher and a muzzle (in case the dog got snippy), and take the dog back to the hospital (Mom followed in her car), where the Dr. was able to diagnose and treat their dog.  Not only were they able to get the dog's pain under control and managed, the Dr. and staff put my parents' minds at ease.  Both pup and parents are doing much, much better today.

I had a nasty fall last Sunday hit my head, shin and bruises on my thigh. The shin started to look nasty; shiny, red, swollen and very painful. My doctor directed me to get immediate treatment. On my way out I ran into my next door neighbor who is a physician. She did a brief exam, hot and infected she said.  I went to the ER and was seen by a horse's potoot dressed in physician assistant's clothing. He said there was no infection, just keep it elevated and apply heat. He agreed to give me an RX for Keflex but said not to start it for a few days. I picked up my purse and walked out. Then to Express. NP Tanya was concerned about a fracture as well as my head. Xrays no fractures thank goodness. Drew a line around the huge cellulitis and bruse and cautioned me to watch for any spread as well as symptoms of a blood clot.  Topical and a strong oral antibiotic and home.  I was seen quickly and treatment was very thorough. I would not hesitate to recommend.", "stars": 5}

{"text": "We were referred to Reverse Aging by a friend because my husband had just gone through Congestive Heart Failure. She told us that Reverse Aging would be able to detox and purify his body from all the meds he takes. So we went and met Diane the owner and she was a \"hoot\". She is full of energy and very knowledgeable on health and wellness. She started my husband off on DoTerra oils and used the compass machine to figure out what his body was deficient of. Then from this point Diane had him start with the Infrared Thera Sauna. My husband couldn't believe the color of his urine and the smells that were coming off of his body. He started feeling so much better, with less pain, less inflammation, and more energy. He also utilized the other machines that Reverse Aging carries, but the best for him was the Sauna. So much so that we ended up buying one for our house. Diane has helped my husbands health immensely!. Since using the combination of the DoTerra oils and Sauna, his blood oxygen levels have stayed at 100% and so have his liver and kidney count. The doctors couldn't believe it because he is on so many meds that should be lowering these counts. I highly recommend Reverse Aging!!!", "stars": 5}

I found Aquaseal on the web and called and talked to Pierre for about 15 minutes. He did some troubleshooting on the issue and recommended some further steps for me to take to assess the situation. After removing the drywall to find the source, I found a foundation crack and a window well issue and did some leak tests recommended by Pierre. I emailed some pictures and my findings to him and he called me and spent another 30 minutes on the phone with me walking me through his diagnosis and my options. He was very knowledgeable, accurate and upfront with the options, process and pricing and was not interested in wasting anyone's time or money. I contacted another company for a second quote but was never even able to get a call back. I was comfortable enough with Aquaseal based on my conversations with Pierre to go ahead and have the work done. They showed up on time and were quick, efficient, professional and transparent and walked me through every step and made sure I was comfortable and in agreement with the work to be done. I ended up having a number of rod hole leaks in the foundation as well as a foundation crack and window well drain problem. Aquaseal repaired the foundation, fixed the window well drain, added a second drain line and replaced the window well. Based on my experience with Aquaseal, I would highly recommend them for similar repairs.\n\nReview by Todd. M CC by Mitch. A", "stars": 5}

It wasn't my favorite, but I heard several people say they really liked the chocolate and we only had a few left at the end of the reception.\n\n* Strawberry Delight - Vanilla with strawberry was pretty popular with the crowd too.  We had a few of these left over after the reception.\n\n* Marie's Cherry -  Vanilla with chocolate mousse that was very tasty!  I had one of these the next day and found it to be very good.  Not my first flavor combination, but the cupcake itself was really good!\n\nWe ordered 72 cupcakes and ended up with 25 people at the reception.  We wanted to have enough for folks to take home a cupcake if they wanted and with the size of these (they are biggies), we figured 1-2 per person with a few taking some home would be good.

On one hand, mediocre restraint like Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining can get a 4.5 here with thousands of reviews , while carnival seafood buffet is only getting 3 .  Anyhow, I was a regular to the old seafood buffet, and the new one i thought was as good as the old one if not better. The regular buffet included some seafood (some crab legs as well), but the ones inside the seafood section that requires a $15 buy up is definitely worth it.  No regarding the line..it's always like that on weekends /holidays. So if you want to avoid the wait, either come during weekday, or somehow have vip line access that let you by pass the wait.  I had the vip access card from SPG platinum membership, so we got seated right the way (btw, that vip access is great for the buffet of buffet since all the participating buffets have vip lines, including Cesar - thus you can maximize the buffet pass).  There are two entrances to the buffet, the one closed to the hotel/casino entrance is intended for the regular buffer, and the one further way was intended for the seafood buffet. But in reality, you can use either entrance for the seafood buffet, so pick the one with shorter lines.  The drawback of using the \"regular buffet\" entrance is that you will be seated a bit far away from the seafood section.", "stars": 5}

It of course comes with your standard 2 scoops of rice, but I was absolutely giddy when I saw the area with all the Korean veggies.  You can select 4 veggie sides with your plate.

Now if they only had shoyu potatoes and daikon, I'd be in heaven.  \n\nThe meat jun was seasoned perfectly and flavorful.  The egg coating was crisp and it was well coated over the each piece of meat, not falling off like at other places.  It wasn't greasy at all, and the dipping sauce was delicious as well.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is easy to find right off the ASU campus.  There is metered parking along the street (a quarter gets you only 10 minutes!).  The food is fresh yet comes out quickly.

{"text": "My foie gras was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  But long after I forget the taste, I will remember the path I took eating it.  You see, as the gentleman seated at the table next to us explains, the food at this restaurant is absolutely wonderful, but not the best in Vegas---you pay the  approx $110 per plate because of the presentation and the service.  Well said, my friend.  \n\nOur path begins wandering through the strip trying to find a place to eat that suits our mood.  Unaware that we found a world class restaurant, we stumble into Le Cirque and ask if we could be seated.  \"In the parlor\" she says with her pleasantly but assertive French accent.  I am tempted to fall for the accent, but my mom is French, and I naturally rebel to that sound.  No merci, I say, we will try something else.  Mon dieu! a table for two somehow opened in the main restaurant.  I am not offended. Rather a bit proud, as if I passed a test..why must the French always test??  \n\nThe restaurant is aptly named.  The Bellagio fountains shooting off every now and then seen through the window are only background to the real show.  Under the tent is a hub-bub of activity with servers hustling here and there drawing laughs, suggesting wines, shaking hands, catering to whims..... You might suspect it to be noisy, but you are incorrect.  The decor is themed and consists pleasantly of soft orange and yellow and browns.     There must be a busy and jolly impressionist painting somewhere that is the inspiration.        \n\nBack to the foie gras.  You start with the first bite, it melts.  As you make you way through the dish, each bite exposes a new series of tasty gems---oils , raisins, cranberries, nuts and different oils.  The fresh finish is a small tumble of clover.  \n\nThe wine, chosen by our server because we really have no idea how to choose from the hundred or so wines that range from $80 to several thousand dollars, smelled like roses. Oh no! we realize that we have not given ourselves enough time to fully enjoy this experience and make it to the 10:30 show.  \"Monsieur, I regret to inform you that I have some unpleasant news.. you see, we have tickets.\"  \"Oui, of course, I will make it work, I promise.\"  With a clap our new advocate chastises the nearest of the many staffers milling about---\"where is their food---they have been waiting...  Do not worry my friends,\"  Within minutes it is here.. my canard is in rich and flavorful medallions.  Not quite the foie gras, but excellent.   After two aperitifs each supplied, gratis, by you know who, the question of desert is our top issue.  One choice for something with chocolate and another for coconut.  She has made reference to the chocolate at least five times since we were there two days ago.  Mine was a fluffy creamy thing presented in a shell and provided a sweet surprise at the bottom.     We paid (ouch) and somehow made it to the show just as the music began!  \n\nI suggest that your path finds its way to Le Cirque. It is not only a restaurant but a journey.", "stars": 5}

He apologized for the delay, didn't make excuses, and told me my dinner was on them!

The bathroom was the cherry on top - L'Occitane shampoo/conditioner/lotion/shower gel, heated(!) toilet seat, rain shower head, and a precise shower temperature control. (I'm honestly going to incorporate some of what they had in that bathroom in my own master bathroom renovation.) There was also free, fast WiFi. And the included breakfast was very good and filling.

The staff is insanely friendly and knowledgable, the food is to die for and there is a giant selection of beers to choose from. \n\nHowever, this last experience I had was ridiculous. I would love to give this place 5 stars of course but I now want to give it 1 after what happened. I'll settle and take one away from the original 5. My husband and I decided to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous. Lunch on the patio at my favorite place...what could go wrong? Well started off great until our \"waitress\" (parentheses because I almost wouldn't call her one.) ruined our day. \n\nWe noticed there was a new menu with seasonal items, we asked questions about some of the food and Irene could not tell us a thing. She had to grab the other waitress in the area to tell us. We asked a few more questions and she would have to dart off to the kitchen and bar to find out the answers. She didn't know some of the items on the actual menu either. That's fine, maybe she was new. We tried to forgive her, however she seemed very uninterested in serving our table, that was UNTIL I got up to use the restroom. When I returned found her bent over the table trying to shove her pushup boobs in my husbands face. Trying to be cute and flirty, flipping her hair and giggling. I don't think so hunny. As soon I reached the table she walked away. Sorry to interrupt your conversation with MY husband. \nAfter that as we were eating our food she made a point to bend over directly in front of my husband to clean a table. Normally I wouldn't have said a thing about it except for the fact that her skirt was so short she was giving my husband a free show. Not only that but her purposely turning around and making direct eye contact with him while doing so was very inappropriate. She continued to ignore me the entire time. It was like I was watching her attempt to seduce my husband in front of my own eyes. Both of us were very uncomfortable and finished our food quickly and paid our bill. \n\nI waited up front to try to speak with a manager about what had just occurred but the hosts told me they were in the middle of an interview and might be a few minutes. I decided to write this review in hopes that a manager will read this to see what kind of trash they now have on their staff.

There's a beautiful patio out back - perfect for enjoying a tea or beer or a cocktail of tea and beer mixed together (barf). \n\nOne of the things I like is that there's a real sense of pride about what they do - they make delicious, unbelievable food out of beautiful raw ingredients. There's no goofy funny vibe, like oh, haha, this is so crazy, I'm somewhere that serves RAW food hey waiter I think the chef forgot to cook my meal hahaha hahhahahahahha somebody punch me. It's not a novelty restaurant that you just \"try\" for \"fun\" - this is a nice meal out at a nice place.\n\nAnd it is. The preparation is always beautiful - the sandwiches, wraps, and raw plates all have bright greens in accompaniment, and things like \"dehydrated onion-flax bread\" are earthy-looking and pretty. Nothing here is bland, vegan mush. I'm not saying that as a carnivore who hearts bacon too much to give tempeh a fair chance - I was a vegan for months, and I happily cooked myself and ate PLENTY of mush. It was tasty! Just not very pretty. The food here looks like Tyra Banks. It is fierce.\n\nIt also tastes great. I've been here a ton, and almost everything is good. My favorite is the burdock burrito - the kimchi in it is amazing, and I'm pretty sure Live makes their own. The wraps and sandwiches are all good. I find their 'burger' patties can be on the blander side, but the sauces and extras more than make up for it. Definitely recommend trying to raw platter, too. At $20, it's  kinda steep, but you get a lot of food (be warned though, that it's hard to split...messy....) but if you're eating here to try cool raw things, this is what to go for. In many times eating there, I've only had one thing I didn't like - raw gazpacho. There was barely any tomato in it, and it was syrupy and sweet. Do not want, would not eat again.\n\nThe smoothies are ok - I'm not big on smoothies anyway. Desserts are delicious but REALLY heavy and sweet. And I think that's my one big criticism. I feel that icky full/sickish feeling after eating here - they don't use butter or cream, obviously, but there's a lot of cashews and lots of sweetener in the desserts, and the sauces on the dishes can still manage to be quite rich.

This location is not the nicest but not the worst I've been to.\n\nThe older lady at the counter was super nice and even asked me how my day was going, which was a pleasant surprise and refreshing.  Normally you get some kid that has no clue and is there just to enter orders.\n\nAnyways the pretzel burger, I was thinking that it may be a bit heavy but the bun was actually light and flavorful.  The sauce with this burger has a slight sweetness and balances the savory sins of bacon and cheese.  Can't comment on the fries as I just wanted to try the burger out.\n\nI would get it again.", "stars": 4}

They don't advertise that it's msg free and I can't be 100% sure but it did pass the test and wasnt uber thirsty after and no head ache the next morning. Thumbs up!\n\nOther half got the lemon grass chicken sate with spring roll and commented it was one of the best chicken rice dishes he's had in a while. It was spicy and you could actually taste the lemon grass. \n\nPrice, XL pho $10 something and the chicken dish was over $13.

I consider this place expensive, with it being almost twenty dollars for just an order of beef broccoli and a side of fried rice.

{"text": "First Yelp review and first visit to Kiku's Markham location.  They also have a location in Don Mills\n\nGreat AYCE restaurant.  Very nice modern decor and attentive wait staff.  Each table has an iPad on which the diners can see a picture of everything on the menu and use the iPad to place their orders.   After ordering the iPad slides into a pocket under the table which gets it out of the way when the food starts arriving.   \n\nThe menu is large and varied and with a few exceptions, everything was excellent.  Standouts included the tempura shrimp, the baked muscles and the hand rolls.  The only let downs were the rather bland breaded scallops and the Ika Yaki (whole grilled squid) which was over cooked and chewy.  \n\nOverall a great experience and a solid 4 out of 5.", "stars": 4}

{"text": "Since the hotel looks like a castle and my boys loved that part of it and my oldest really enjoyed the Tournament of Kings show and the Fun Dungeon, I will give the hotel one star. The beds were also super comfortable!\n\nNow the reasons for the lack of stars.....\nAfter arriving in Las Vegas for our first time, the airport shuttle dropped us off at the hotel with a 9 year old, a 2 year old, and 8 bags, we walked into the hotel only to find that we were dropped off in the rear of the hotel and was very rudely informed by a security guard that there was a phone to call a bell hop. After 3 attempts to call the bell hop and being put on hold for extended periods of time, we gave up and walked to the complete opposite end of the hotel to check in. Once arriving at the opposite end of the hotel there was a line to wait in (which took an hour) to check in. \nWe finally get to our room and request more towels and such since there are 4 of us and only 3 sets of towels. We go to eat and when we come back, the towels are on the counter in the bathroom. I lift up one of the towels to move it and there is a large clump of dark hair on the towels which I can understand being missed in the probably massive amounts of laundry that the hotel has to do it the day, but similar instances happened on 3 occassions. One time clumps of hair, second time brown stains on the mats, and the third time brown stains on a towel. All of these on 3 different days and 3 different occassions. That is not forgiveable. \nThe first impression is everything!\nOn day 3 of being at the hotel and out walking around for 6-7 hours we were sore and wore out when we got back to the hotel and we decided to take turns going to get massages at the spa. I went first. When I got down to the spa I wanted to add on a foot rub to my 25 minute massage but apparently it takes 2 different people to make a back massage and foot massage happen and even though it is a total of 50 minutes of massages between the 2, I was told it would take an hour and a half. So I cancel the foot massage because my boyfriend's massage we only an hour after mine. I go back to the women's locker room and the girl sitting at the desk says that I am already running on my time and I have to shower before I can get my massage. So I am thinking that she means that I am using up my 25 minutes worth of massage so I explain that my appointment isn't until 4:30 (it was currently 4:20). Her response was that my time starts 15 minutes before my appointment. I rinse off with water and proceed to wait in the sitting area for my massage. I bring it up to the girl checking people in that it should be explained to people when they set up an appointment that they need to tell people that they need to be there early. She argues back that they did. My boyfriend was literally still on the phone making the appointments when I left the room and headed to the spa. Now the hotel may be big, but it is definitely not that big. As I am struggling with the staff there are 2 other women who openly share their dissatisfaction with the spa also for different reasons. One told me that I would pay more if I went to the Luxour or the MGM but I looked up the prices for massages at them and they were very similar to the Excalibur prices. If I would have known that before my massage, I would have happily taken my business elsewhere. I was there to relax, not be rushed by someone. \nSome other things that were a problem are.......\n1. The timeshare people always bothering you.\n2. The amount of smoke was terrible. \n3. The one time we went to the Lobby Lounge for drinks the bartender was slow and the ratio on both my drink and my boyfriends was completely off. \n4. Only offered one show and that was the Tournament of Kings. (A word to the wise, you can get the souvenir cups for $8 at the 24/7 store upstairs instead of paying $14 at the show)\n\nOverall, it is waaaay better than Circus Circus to stay if you have kids but the kid amenities can be visited without being a hotel guest.

The chilled Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail was out of this world. Of course so was the price at $20, but it is Vegas after all. Nothing comes cheep, so be prepared to spend.

Answered all my questions. Helped me make an informed decision. Fixed my car the following day. Which I feel is reasonable. I will go back again & I would recommend to my friends.

When I phoned to book the appointment for my massage, they told me they had relocated to Bowness.  No problem.  I arrive at the location, from the outside its in a rickety old strip mall, no big deal.  I go inside.  Basically right in front of the door is a desk and a tiny waiting area.  I am greeted by the receptionist and a man standing beside the desk.  He is wearing all black covered in lint and hairs, he is not, shall we say, well-groomed and professional looking.  He could use a shave and a lint brush.  I had a bad feeling and my instinct was to leave but I stayed as I thought it can't be that bad.  Should have left.  \n\nWorse massage ever.  This man is my masseuse.  He leads me to a room that is half painted and looks to be falling apart.  Its a tiny room with a massage table and bright lights.  I reluctantly get under the sheet.  He comes back, puts a Tracy Chapman CD into the player and pulls out a bottle of pump lotion.  I know its not a fancy place, but lotion from a pump for a massage?? The lotion and his hands are freezing.  I tell him to focus on my upper back and shoulders only.  He must not have eaten lunch because I could hear his stomach rumbling or maybe it was his bowels.  He talked the whole time and I could feel his nasty breath on my neck.   I gave minimal one word answers hoping he would take the hint.  No, I don't care that they couldn't afford the rent at the old location nor do I care that they lose money on all the online deals they sell.  The massage wasn't good.  He repeatedly told me to \"loosen up\", and would tap me with his fingers.  He would also dig his elbow in my glutes which I did not appreciate as I told him to focus on the upper body only.  That 30min felt like an eternity.  Finally it was over.\n\nI had prepaid when I had bought the coupon online.  This was the worst massage experience I had ever had and I was trying to run out the door.  And no, I wasn't going to tip.  I tip 99% of the time, but this was not an enjoyable experience.  He told me I had to pay the \"taxes\".  Fine, I pulled out my credit card.  He asked if I had cash.  I said no.  He said don't worry about it then.  Nice.

There was a group of about 6 of us, got a table on the patio.  We ordered a bunch of starters and a couple ordered meals.  I used to LOVE the nachos here, had them many times in the past.  Used to get the large size, it would be super huge, heaping with cheese and toppings.

I brought along extensions and requested to have them put in. After my hair, I had my makeup done because it was a special occasion. BIG mistake!! I provided many pictures along with a detailed explanation of what I wanted. I was going for a natural look with neutral colors used. I said this along with providing pictures. I was given a purple crease and shimmery gold lid. I also asked for a small amount of eyeliner and my stylist, Ashly, applied thick winged eyeliner that extended nearly to my eyebrows. I was in shock that she would leave it on so I politely asked her to fix it. After three attempts all she managed to do was smudge the eyeliner and leave it. It was still very thick with large wings but now, just smudged. Overall I was very upset with the look and the foundation was not a match for my skin tone. When I was checking out the front desk lady \"suggested\" I leave $9 for each stylist as a tip, because that was 20% before even asking what I felt comfortable leaving. I am a generous tipper but my makeup was a waste of time and money! I felt obligated to do so and awkward to voice my concern so I just nodded and left. Upon getting a closer look at my makeup on my way home I ended up washing my face and redoing it all myself. Save your money or go to MAC because I redid my entire look and was then late to my graduation lunch. I was very upset at my experience here and would not recommend it to anyone.

{"text": "I hired Farnsworth Realty & Management Company over six years ago to manage a rental property (9426 w. Virginia Ave Phoenix, AZ) my husband and I own.  We were looking for a trustworthy company to manage the property as we are not in Phoenix, Arizona where the property is located. For the first few years everything went well. However, I started noticing that the property went unrented for five-seven months at a time. This home is an investment property and a source of income for my family, having it unrented for such a long period of time is money lost. In the more recent years working with them, I was confused several times with other clients. One example of this is I was once billed $1,400 for a garage door on a home belonging to another client of theirs. They blamed it on a filing mix up. Human error happens, so I let it go and continued on with them. On April 1, 2011, the current tenants moved in and were given keys to the house and the mailbox. The tenants informed management that the mailbox key was not working. Perhaps they were given the wrong key. Instead of replacing said key, they resorted to name-calling; they called the tenant \"bipolar.\" This is no way to conduct you in a professional setting. This was a simple issue that could have been easily resolved but instead was turned into quit an ordeal. The final, most important issue happened on April 20, 2011. The tenant noticed there was a problem with the air conditioning when they attempted to use it. Naturally, we sent a professional to take a look at the situation. As it turns out, the air conditioning condenser had been stolen. The management company is required to conduct an inspection when a tenant moves out of the home.  It is obvious that many things were over looked in the inspection, that is, if an inspection was ever done at all. This error is now costing me $3,500 to rectify. Also, in the Move-In Inspection Report filed by the new tenants, there were many issues. There were problems with cleanliness, holes in the front door and a non-functioning outlet. These were all issues that management should have been aware of prior to new tenants moving in. Not only should they have been aware but they also should have made me aware of the situation if it was that bad. I trusted them to take excellent care of my property and those living in it as I would if I were there. I trusted them to do their job. Instead of taking responsibility for their mistakes they have given me the run around and have yet to resolve the issue. This entire situation has been an extreme lack of professionalism.

Please don't be fooled, it's worse that many of the branded motels I've stayed before.  We paid an extra $55 to get a bigger room with 2 bathrooms and a jacuzzi.  Then the front desk tells us we need to pay an additional $15 for their club usage and internet. (which we don't use or need) So total around $140/night.

Cups, kettle, coffee machine, water bottle, microwave no where to be found etc..etc.  So we are Asian and we're used to drinking hot tea or hot water in the morning.  So we asked housekeeping whether they can get us a kettle.  \"sorry, we don't have kettles. I'll transfer you to room service\".  okay...so I spoke with them and asked for some hot water and two cups.  They said \"sure, but it'll be $4.50\".

They do not give refunds. I explained that I had only purchased this unit on his advice. I had the coin with me and asked the salesman to test the unit in front me and see for himself how it performs. He flatly refused and told me if I was not satisfied with the unit, to contact the manufacturer. It was out of his hands. I asked if their establishment stood behind the products they sell, he again said, all problems should be directed to the manufacturer and had nothing to do with them.\n\nI then Inquired as to why I was not told at the point-of-sale about their return policies. He explained, it was all written on the bottom of the sales invoice, which of course is after the sale is made.

First the owner John insists that his guys start as early as possible when we wanted them there at 9 so we agree to 8am. I am glad we did not agree to the 6am he was pushing in the heat because the movers did not even show up until 11am! We requested 4 movers and only 2 show up late. Eventually an hour later the 3rd shows up and then a few hours after that he has to go back to his half way house or he is going back to prison. So my boyfriend and I are left moving everything ourselves with just 2 movers from 8am to 10pm. We were in miserable pain from this. We had to do almost all the work ourselves to meet our moving timeline. We could not get our chicken coop moved without the help of 4 movers. John was told this repeatedly yet still failed to provide the movers we needed on both occasions.  John promises that everything will be finished and he will send four movers over the following day to finish moving the final items and the chicken coop at no additional charge. Again they were late, they didnt have the right number of guys and that they were only there \"to move the chicken coop and then we have to go to another job\" my boyfried became irate, called John and said they would not be leaving until they had actually finished the move they promised to do. John acted offended like his business problems were our fault and kept saying he wasnt charging us for that day....yet we had already paid the $1000 quoted on the move with four movers that should have been done in 6 hours not 18 hours with 2 movers and the customer getting stuck doing everything themself. I do not trust this moving company and will certainly never ever use them again. The movers also broke our rocking chair, birdbath, garbage can, candle holder and dining table.

(Maraschino Sidecar and Old Fashioned, both decent) She also brought us warm, fresh bread, which was welcome on this particularly cold night.\n\nWe placed our order with the waitress, who somehow talked us in to a few items that we didn't need, but she had mentioned them so casually, it made them sound like they were included, or just a slight up charge. (I should say that being pretty young still, we are generally pretty modest about money, but this was a really special occasion meal, so we splurged. And to be fair, we didn't ask directly how much they would cost. Still, we ended up spending more than we anticipated.) \n\nThe side Cesar salad I ended up ordering with my steak was $7, and was pretty lackluster to be honest. You can get a cheaper, larger, and far more flavorful Cesar at Ian's Pizza! My date also said yes to saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on his steak which was another $7! Saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and/or onions should not cost that much... Come on.\n\nAnyway, we ordered a side of Mac and cheese, which was good enough, but the flavor sort of disappeared as I was eating my steak.\n\nThe steaks! They were phenomenal! I ordered the petite sirloin, blackened. The blackening seasoning was sooooooo good. Nicely crusted, without being too overbearing. And for the potato, I chose a crispy golden frisbee of house made hash-browns. Oh my gosh, it was amazing!\n\nMy date had the ribeye and garlic mashed potatoes. He always cleans his plate, but he ended up taking half of the meal home because of the size of it. He said it was cooked to his liking (medium rare).

Thick, crusty bread with a few different cheeses and hot soup to dip in-- perfect comfort food. \n\nWhen opting to go a little healthier, I love their sweet corn Caesar salad. It's flavorful, with green onions and red and poblano peppers on top, along with sweet kernels of fresh corn. In the past, when I've added chicken, there was one time that it was over-salted, but I've ordered it at least a dozen times, so I forgave it as a fluke.\n\nEverything else has been wonderful too, they have a delicious selection of sandwiches, and their dinner entrees have been great too. \n\nSeating can get cozy when they're busy, but it's never bugged me.

Really tasty and hearty, but nothing we couldn't do at home. The potatoes were really good though-- not overly fried or seasoned. 2) Chicken and a Biscuit. A huuuge piece of crispy fried white meat balanced on a flavorful biscuit. Topped with an egg (I asked for mine scrambled, which they were happy to do) with a flavorful sausage gravy and greens on the side. I'm not sure how one could make sausage gravy look appealing, and I've got to be honest, the look turned me off for a minute. Without being too frank, the peach-orange color and chunks of sausage an corn looked a little bit... uh... gross. That being said, once you get past that, it's really delicious! I swear! The greens on the side were a nice way to balance the heavy dish. 3) Chocolate Pancakes. To. Die. For. But they might as well remove the \"pan\" part. Between the chocolate in the batter and the chocolate buttercream on top, it's really a dessert. \n\nIn all, it wasn't the healthiest breakfast, but we were there to go big, and we did.

Served four to an order, they were crisp on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside served with a spicy tomato sauce. \n\nBeef Tartare: The waitress said that this dish has a following. People come in just to order this. My date and I had never tried anything tartare before, but we were feeling adventurous, so we went for it! I'm glad we did. I can't say that I'll be returning just for this dish, but it was a good experience. You get a relatively small amount of beef, but really, how much raw meat do you need to eat in one sitting? It comes on a massive salty cracker topped with a boiled quail egg, cheese, anchovies, and radishes. There's a lot of flavor just on that cracker. Break a bit off, add some beef and BOOM. You're hit with all those savory flavors and a crisp and cold combination. It's a little pricey at $13.00, but definitely worth a try.\n\nMy date is a big fan of mussels, so of course he wanted the Prince Edward Island Mussels. He really enjoyed them, served with pork belly, wine, tomato and garlic broth. He drank the broth without hesitation.\n\nWe also tried the wood-fired pizza with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella pearls, broccoli rabe, garlic and red chili flakes. Good flavors, but the crust was a little limp in the center of the pizza. Not sure if it was because it was too thin, or there was too much moisture on it, but it was a bit sad. Hopefully that was just a fluke though. \n\nLooking forward to going back to try more!", "stars": 4}

This caused some confusion for a customer who say next to us after we had ordered. The man who took our order was not the friendliest, but he wasn't particularly rude. I felt like maybe he just needed to drink some of the delicious Colectivo coffee they serve.\n\nWhen ordering coffee, he asked if I wanted medium or dark roast, decaf, or flavored. They have labels out for all of the options to help you decide. I went with dark, and it was nice and hot when served to me. I think that Colectio delivers it throughout the day, because while we were there, a woman walked in with two containers full of hot coffee.\n\nMy friend had an Oreo waffle which was crammed with chocolate. The Oreo cookie bits added a nice crunch. I went with the Elvis, which was topped with creamy peanut butter, bananas, and chocolate sauce. It was sooooo delicious. \n\nThe eating area is cozy an during our meal, sstaff came out and chatted with some regular customers. \n\nI will definitely be going back to check out all the other waffle options and maybe even the savory options too.", "stars": 4}

It filled up by 7:00 though, with a mostly older crowd.\n\nOrdered a small, thin crust pizza and kept it pretty simple, adding only fresh basil. If you're into \"the works\" on your pizza, be wary, as you pay a hefty amount for each additional topping. Luckily, a basic pizza is all you need. The crust is absolutely delicious-- oil-based, and crisp. The traditional pizza sauce is flavorful, and the addition of fresh basil (julienne) was great. Another in our party ordered the Sicilian Salad, and said it was fresh and flavorful. A good sized salad for the $8.50 price tag.\n\nIt took about an hour to get our food, but I think it was worth the wait. I have to wonder what Greenbush is like on the weekend, but I'll probably stick to weeknights!\n\nOh, and as everyone else said, low ceilings!

Romantically lit with high booth backs.\n\nThe lunch menu was limited to a few pasta dishes, some salads, and sandwiches. My companion ordered a salad and 1/2 portion of the hot cheese bread, which she said had been her go-to for years (a perfect portion, and just healthy enough...) I opted for the manicotti with tomato sauce-- two delicate rolls of fresh pasta filled with just enough cheese and spinach, baked in a flavorful sauce. It was a perfect lunch portion, supplemented with bread and spiced oil. \n\nThe price was right at about $10 with lemonade.

{"text": "I feel as though I need to start this off by saying I had never been to the old Avenue. Driven past it many times, yes. Heard great tales about it, yes. Actually stopped by, nope! I'll blame this on my West-side tendencies. Anyway...\n\nI think the \"new\" Avenue is great! I love the interior. Sleek and Mod, with beautiful finishes!\n\nMy date and I went on a Saturday night, without a reservation. We were told the wait was 30 minutes and it was suggested that we grab a drink at the bar. My date grabbed a seat on the long, low banquettes in the front of the bar (a really nice place to wait), and I bellied on up to the \"bubble up bar\". This was my only point of (minor) disappointment with Avenue. It took quite a while to get drinks. I get it though, Saturday night = prime bar time! But even when someone did take my order, it was quite a wait before she got around to making my drink, and I watched her make several for other customers. I was actually surprised she remembered what I ordered after all that! For such a long bar, and the need to make drinks for seated tables as well as bar customers, it seemed like they could have used one or two more staff members behind it. But hey, a minor issue, really. I was probably just thirsty. \n\nThe drinks though, they were tasty. My date went with the Sparkling Negroni ($9) and I tried the Spicy Grapefruit Fizz (Also $9, but... muddled jalapeno!). Both were flavorful and strong.\n\nAfter we were seated at our table (a cute comfortable very round spot at the back of the restaurant) we perused the menu and I have to say, everything sounded pretty good. So, we decided to go with what our waitress referred to as a \"parade\" of their shareable items.\n\nMy date, feeling somewhat adventurous was craving the fresh oysters and beef carpaccio. I didn't eat them (not my thing) but he reported they were good. \n\nWe split an order of walleye fingers, which were tasty. Two crispy breaded cuts of walleye paired with a shaved brussels sprouts salad, a grilled? lemon and house-made tartar sauce. Standard fare for Wisconsin, and Avenue delivered.\n\nWe also had the short rib, white cheddar \"croquettes\". These should probably be renamed \"arancini\". The difference being: arancini are made with rice whereas croquettes are made with smooth mashed potatoes. These were indeed mrice balls filled with meat, which left me a bit disappointed because I was expecting a different texture. That being said, the short rib meat inside was delicious, as was the tomato sauce they were served with. I didn't taste much of the cheddar, which I think may have just been grated on top.\n\nAs silly as this is, perhaps my favorite item was the dish of fried pickle chips. YUM! Well seasoned, but not TOO salty. Not at all soggy, like some are. And the green goddess sauce on the side... perfect! What can I say, I love a good fried pickle.\n\nOverall, a nice experience and I look forward to going back!", "stars": 4}

You could probably fit six people on the booths, but there might be enough room for half of their legs and 1.5 entrees on the table.\n\nThat being said, they make a pretty decent brandy old fashioned.

Having had certain experiences with frogs in my life, I did not try them, but they actually smelled garlicky and delicious. They arrived breaded, fried, and nested on a sort of sweet and sour sauce. He devoured the whole plate, I watched in fascination.\n\nThe server brought us some warm, dilly bread, which was quite tasty. We stashed it on the booth seat next to us for lack of table space.\n\nThen... The entrees... My beau ordered the rabbit (clearly a fan of jumping foods) which felt sort of small in portion size. Still, it was deliciously breaded and pan fried. Cooked perfectly and nicely tender. My steak arrived sizzling on a metal plate with a giant onion ring on top. It was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. The hash browns on the side were also pretty good, though not he best I've had at a steakhouse.

I think she was maybe adjusting to using a tablet to take orders. Whatever happened to writing them down?!\n\nStarted with some beers and the chips and beer cheese dip. The appetizer was warm and flavorful. They were out of several beers, which the waitress listed so quickly that I forgot which ones they were and tried to order two of said beers. None the less, I eventually got the hibiscus saison, which was a beautiful color, dry, and bubbly. I really wish that they offered a tasting flight, but I didn't see it on the menu anywhere. Everyone else in the group seemed to enjoy their beer choices too, but it would have been nice to sample them before ordering.\n\nI had a chicken wrap and tots. Loved the tots!

Icon Dental roped me into getting a root canal and a crown even though there was an infection in the tooth.  After getting the crown put on, I still had the same pain as the day I walked into their office.  He refers me for a follow up and I am told I have to have major work done to remove the infection since no antibiotics worked.  They tell me they have to rip my gums open to clean out the infection when it could have and should have been taken care of during the root canal.  This guy is the worst!!  Icon Dental is not much better at all.  After being charged over $1300 they want to charge me another $1400 to do what he should have done from day 1!!!

We wanted a rest from the pretentiousness of the Strip restaurants for a change, and since we had rented cars, it was no problem to drive out to Todd's, only 15 minutes away from Mandalay Bay down Sunset.  The restaurant was quite busy when we arrived, for a 6:45pm reservation, and its plain to see that there are many regulars who eat here often and are greeted as old friends when they come in the door.\n\nHalf of our large party ordered the Grumpy's salads, they did not disapoint, there was just the right amount of dressing and as a previous reviewer said, those little nuggets of blue cheese hiding in the lettuce were a delightful surprise.  2 had the crab cake appetizer (2 nice sized crab cakes, minimal filler, well seasoned and very tasty!) , one had the beet salad with a grapefruit dressing, very light and refreshing and good counterpoint to the beets, and I had the spinach salad with lamb bacon, which was also nicely dressed, not heavy at all.\n\nFor entrees, 2 people had the seared scallops, 3 had the sea bass on tomato risotto, 1 each the ahi tuna, and the NY steak, and I had the short ribs.  The only disappointing entree that didn't get raved about was the NY steak, which was on the tough side, but had great flavor!.  There were several dietary issues in the group (onion allergy, dairy allergy, starch preference) which the restaurant handled with aplomb and grace.   The short ribs were melt in your mouth tender, (just a tad salty for me), and our waiter gladly swiched out the jalapeno mashed potatoes for the plain ones since I'm a spice wimp.  The fish and scallop eaters said their entrees were prepared perfectly and very yummy.\n\nThe restaurant comped 2 \"\"Todd-a-misu's\", their mini version of Tiramisu, for the two birthday boys, which was a very nice gesture from the restaurant.   For dessert, we ordered a couple of the cobbler of the day, (one peach, strawberry, raspberry), along with a slightly different one since they ran out  (apple, peach, I think)--both dishes were served with ice cream and licked clean!", "stars": 4}

Over the years, i have had countless wonderful experiences at various Safeway's across the state. And I have been known to express my love for Safeway numerous times in public. I don't know how it's possible for a manger to screw up a grocery store more than this. Doesn't corporate come by every once and a while? \n\nI am grateful to read that I\"m not the only one with this impression. Every time I go, they're out of something. And I\"m not talking about Peruvian Wild Goats Milk or some other obscure specialty food. I\"m talking basics. Bread, milk, soda.\n\nBut my main issue is their Signature Sandwich Deli. It is atrocious. A few years ago, I remember people would be lined up to get their sandwiches here. Not anymore. The service is incredibly slow, the sandwiches are made poorly and there is always something missing, or low. And getting a bin refilled seems to be a monumental task, so it just doesn't get done. Today, they hadnt' refilled the artichokes. When I asked for artichokes, instead of refilling it and giving me artichokes, the guy behind the counter took the artichoke JUICE and dribbled it on my sandwich, making it impossible to eat without a fork and spoon later. I just don't ever recall that a sandwich required silverware. \n\nThe time prior, I went and they were out of tomatoes. Huh? IT\"S A GROCERY STORE! Walk over to the produce and pick up a tomato!\n\nThe time before that, I just wanted a chilled Coke. Sounds simple. Popular brand. Large grocery chain. What could possibly go wrong? Well, for one, they hadn't stocked the refrigerators by the registers. When I inquired about getting a coke, the staff looked at the cooler that had 2 Dr. Peppers left and asked me, \"Well, do you want a Dr. Pepper?\"\n\"NO! I want a Coke.\" \n\nNo matter what I go there for, I can't seem to get out of the store without some type of issue.

When guests asked for a little more, the servers said \"NO, you'll have to wait until everyone is served\". The bacon was greasy and undercooked. The potatoes were black and burnt. I've never seen fruit cut into tiny little rectangles with the rind still attached. The waffles looked like Eggos out of a box. They ran out of coffee after ten women had a cup. There were sixty women in attendance. We had to ask for more coffee three times. Each time we had to wait 20 minutes while a new pot brewed. The creamers were always empty and when they ran out of cream they went to the store (while we waited yet again) and brought back a half gallon of milk and set the carton on the table next to the coffee pot. The staff kept coming to our table to try to take our plates while we were still eating. Then at the end of the shower one of the servers was hovering around our homemade deserts (we brought to the event) asking if he could take the food home. He didn't seem too interested in the store bought pastries his boss threw on the buffet. I had my own catering business and still work with other catering companies. This event was very disappointing and in my opinion the caterer is unprofessional. Elegant Affairs by Alfonso's is the caterer you get stuck with when you book an event at the Grand Pacific Junction Hotel. The caterer asked to be paid in full two days before the shower. After my \"granddaughter\" and her mother complained, the caterer refunded about 8% of the total bill. What a joke...I guess he's laughing all the way to the bank.

Once inside the garden, it was very hard to walk around and enjoy the works of art when there were so many people (there was literally no elbow room). They were beautiful works, though. For this particular day's experience, I would give it 3 stars, but I know that in essence, the garden deserves more respect. We saw half of the Mosaicultures works because the crowds tired us out, and did not get to see the Gardens of Light exhibit due to fatigue (it would've been nicer to view after dusk, anyway).

{"text": "The worst chipotle I've ever been to. This is the new location that they moved to/built as part of the shoppes of  parma renovation.\n\nFirst off, they are inconsistent. Most of the time they are ungodly slow (most times). If you see a long line you may as bring a folding chair. I've observed this is partly due to the large volume of online orders they are serving simultaneous to the people in line (this is the only chipotle that seems to get this many online orders - others seem to restrict it a little) - other times just the line not paying attention.\n\nSecondly, usually the portions are small and they move so fast. For example, they scoop beans in a 1 second swoosh without draining them leaving you a puddle of mess in your bowl. Usually you get about 2oz of meat (probably less than half as other chipotles give you). And I usually happily pay the outrageous $2 for guacamole from chipotle because I like it, but here you need to get it on the side or else you'll get a paltry serving size that would fit on a single chip.\n\nThirdly, if you do happen to order online. Don't leave until you double check your order because they will forget things. Everytime I've been here and people have come back because their order is missing something (like dressing, side of salsa, chips).\n\nBut it's chipotle so they'll keep cranking. Personally if I'm craving chipotle it's probably worth the 5-10 minute drive to the next closest one.", "stars": 1}

I wasn't in dire need, so neither was \"bad\", but they were enough to get them done. I was taken back right away and the one woman did my eyebrows first. After the initial wax, she started using tweezers to get missed hairs- except a process that usually takes a minute tops started taking over three minutes of her just plucking. She pinched my skin with the tweezers a couple times and I finally had to tell her that I couldn't have her continue because it was hurting so badly. \n\nNext she did my lip, which went fairly normally at first. She did get wax incredibly close to the corner of my mouth (and a little in). Then she started the plucking again. She was plucking at the small hairs right on the corner of my mouth (and once again, close enough to say she was almost in my mouth) and kept dabbing at the skin under my nose like she was getting extra wax off. \n\nAfter she was done, I found out what she was dabbing- I was actively bleeding from two places. She shooed me out fairly quickly (never gave me a little mirror or anything to see my eyebrows) and when I got to my car, I noticed my eyebrows were noticeably uneven.

{"text": "I typically don't have the time or make the time to review about companies but this one, ARIZONA COLOR PROMOTIONS, I had to!  I reached out to them over the internet to get a wrap done to one of our vehicles.  I already had the design completed from a design firm so I thought this would be an easy transaction.   A woman by the name of Lisa got back to me in a couple days. She said how awesome our design looked and it would be $500 for the installation (partial wrap and some cut vinyl). That was less than any other shop had quoted.  I thought great! I called in spoke with gentlemen on the phone to verify what there installation process was and to make sure this was a quality installation... The gentlemen, who I now know was \"Big Jim\" ranted about some award they won and they are the best...Okay cool I thought great price and they are the best! Perfect combination... I replayed to Lisa's email saying please proceed. Two days later I get an apologetic email from a woman by the name of Samantha saying, \"We made a big mistake\" the price should be $1300.00!  \"Lisa is new, she does not know what she is doing\" but I can get your wrap completed on May 22/23rd which was in a week. This was in line with some of the other quotes price wise I got so I figured that's fine \"They are the best per \"Big Jim\", right? ....and I was leaving out of town so I needed the expedited install date, other shops quoted me 3weeks roughly. Okay fine, let's get it done.  The designer had to look over my design and make his internal tweaks on it, that process was good. The gentleman was efficient, we emailed back and forth the art work was approved in one day, done.  Then I get an email from \"Sam\" that says the install will be June 3/4th.....WHAT! I send an email back to her telling her the original quote for install she said \"that how my schedule works it fills up\".  The same day Lisa sends me an email soliciting me for more business...I emailed her back saying not happening at this point based on the transaction so far...I get a call from \"Big Jim\" after I sent that email...his attitude at first was he is not sure how I assumed that, that was the schedule and where I got that from...after a brief explaination and telling him all of this information I got from your office thru email he backed down..He expressed he was going to fix it and sorry for how it when down....after the phone call I get another email from Sam stating that the install date is the same!!! June 3/4th.  I sent her an email a day later and asked her to cancel the install.  Jim emailed me back and said he did not want to end on these terms and what could we do and he would get me in on Thursday like he said over phone but needed to confirm with Sam...I sent him a reply and thanked him for reaching out but I still would like to cancel and please refund my card.  I did not hear back from him.  I sent two separate emails a few days later one to Sam and one to Jim.  Requesting for the refund and I got no response.  I also called into the shop and requested for the refund to be completed and left a message with Lisa for a call back and I still did not hear from them.  My next step is going to their shop to ask for my refund face to face.  A week and a half after I walked into the wrap shop to ask for my refund, I did get my refund. A big waste of time and exercise I did not need. I ended up with Blue Media, very happy with start to finish transaction.", "stars": 1}

(I usually do not order sushi but other dishes)  The quality of the food is bearable but the service you get, not so. It seems from other reviews this place does this quite often to its customers but my girlfriends I went for a brief lunch on Friday and asked to have our bill split.  When the old Japanese waitress heard that, she got really irritated and said \"we'll add tip to your bill\".  WHAT?? for splitting a check you have to add on the gratuity?  Since there were four of us, we thought, okay whatever.  When it was time for us to order, some of us were bit hesitant trying to decide and the waitress got all frustrated and showed it on her face like she didn't want to be there. OMG, it wasn't like the place was crowded with customers, she had only two other tables and she was working with another waitress.  And after we ordered, she NEVER CAME BACK to our table!!!!  When the food came that was the only time she came back to give us our food, and never came back to check on our drinks or to see if we needed anything.  Fortunately the other young waitress came and tried to tend to our table which was nice of her.  Finally the bill came and she wrote everything down on one sheet and total was like around $59.xx for four of us, and she added 11.80 for tip.  So I asked her if it was cutomary for them to add 20% gratuity.  Then she rolls her eyes and goes \"it's 18%, not 20%\"  What?  I may not be a math genius but that is about 20% not 18% that she claimed.  My girlfriends and I did not want to make a big deal out of 2% difference so we left it at that.  But to be honest, I did not want to leave any tip for her.  I couldn't believe they tagged on gratuitiy simply because we asked to have our bill split.  This was the second visit we wished we had our lunch somewhere else.  I guess we're not coming back here anymore.", "stars": 1}
{"text": "We recently moved into a new house that previous owners had installed a GE water softener that was in use for about 3 years.  When we moved in November it was working okay and just recently I noticed white stains on our sinks and on top of the boilded water so I figured we weren't getting soft water.  So I called around to see if someone could take and look and had this company referred to us from GE company since GE water softener isn't serviced by everyone.  \n\nThe company seemed nice enough when I first called to tell them we're having a problem with our softener and said they'd come out for $85 service charge to take a look.  Well I didn't know much about the water softener and when he came out I told the technician, Mike, that we weren't getting soft water and he pulled it apart and said that meter assembly was missing and that's why it wasn't regenerating automatically and we weren't getting soft water.  Since I didn't know what parts were doing what, I said okay and he quoted me for the part ($165) and another trip charge of ($65) to come back and fix it.  \n\nWell I find out that meter assembly only counts water that we use and triggers the system to regenerate, but we had been regenerating manually and that part missing shouldn't affect the soft water getting into the house.  So I called them again the following day to ask if they can come out again.  Well the older gentleman who answered the phone basicallty said \"your system needs to be replaced if it's that old\".  Yes. I know that.  I was thinking to replace the unit eventually but I wanted to know what was wrong with it first.  \n\nSo I did some research on the internet and found that the problem could be simply the venturi parts being worn out.  \n\nSo I called again this morning to try and speak to Mike.  The older gentleman who answered the phone said Mike was out on the field.  I told him that even though Mike did take a look at our unit and we're still not getting the soft water even though he said \"if you recharge manually then you should get soft water so recharge manually every 3-4 days\".  Obviously when he said that he thought it was working fine but if we're not getting the soft water that meant he might have missed something. \n\n That was my point and wanted to see if he could've missed something.  But now they get very defensive and say he didn't miss anything.  AND TELLS ME MIKE HAS BEEN SITTING NEXT TO HIM LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION!!   Now Mike on the phone gets very very rude and does not listen to what I say but keeps repeating \"I dont' know what you want\".  WELL YOU ARE NOT LISTENING AND THAT'S WHY YOU DONT KNOW WHAT I WANT.  I tell him I want to know what's wrong with it and he says he won't even come out unless we pay $165 + $65 for the meter assembly fix or $199 ventri part fix (which I found on internet that it only cost $49)   And hands the phone over to the other guy who says if you want to replace the unit then call them or otherwise this conversation is OVER.  WHAT????\n\nI paid him $85 to come out and diagnose the problem, which he DID NOT DO.  Yes he did take it apart to tell me there was a part missing.  But the part he said was missing had nothing to do with the PROBLEM, which is us not getting soft water!!  If he had come out and said well it looks like meter assembly is missing but even with manual recharge if you aren't getting soft water there could be other problems. Then I would have thought to replace the unit without a doubt.  But with his diagnose, I was left feeling there was something else wrong- which I was right. It wasn't meter assembly, and that's why I kept calling. (twice that is)\n\nHe may be a good technician (if he is), but both him and the older man (whom I assume is the owner) do not have a good customer service attitude.  Through out the whole conversation over the phone, I could tell they were irritated and didn't want to deal with me.  With him keep repeating \" so what do you want? what do you want? do you want us to come out for free?\"  made me feel like I was asking for some freebees, and I wasn't!   I shouldn't have to pay for them to come out again to diagnose a problem THEY MISSED the first time!  And even if they do not wish to come out, they could've said it in a much kinder, more understanding way, instead of being obnoxious and pushy.\n\nNow I've got another company coming to replace the whole house system TODAY  who has a great review here on the yelp.  \n\nAnd oh, btw, their registrar of contracter license number they so proudly display on their front page of their website has been CANCELLED By them back in 2009!", "stars": 1}

Maybe reheated poorly, as I'm sure it was frozen, not fresh.  The tomato sauce was good but the bread was straight from an old loaf probably purchased at the grocery store.  This dish made me crave Chef Boyardee, it was that bad.

{"text": "Everyone's reviews on this place hit the nail on the head.  It's a great eatery that just happens to be located in East Mesa, but it could be located in Scottsdale or Phoenix or Paradise Valley.  \n\nIf you're hiking, biking, boating or fishing as most East Mesans do, you're sure to pass this place on the NW corner of Power and McDowell, which isn't too far from the Tonto National Forrest and the Salt River.  I swear they pump out heavenly kitchen smells every evening to draw in unsuspecting, hungry drivers.  It works.  \n\nThe restaurant is right off the street facing South on McDowell.  It's a hop, skip and a jump to a Starbucks (that's 100 paces) and has a nice porch with misters for the summer months.  However, you won't be craving Starbucks afterwards because \"The Brew\" as we call it really pushes the fluids.  \n\nCAUTION: If you're bringing someone who has trouble with balance or is disabled or if you are trying to decide which heels to wear when visiting, just note that the floor surface tends to be quite slippery.\n\nI'm not sure in which category the cuisine would be placed, but I'm going to say it's probably predominantly Italian American.  I say that because of the dishes, the pizza selection and sauces used and because this is the one place in Arizona where I would order a Cannoli.  \n\nReal, authentic Cannoli are illusive things.  They can either be filled with cream or custard or Riccota or a combo, which I prefer.  There should really be chocolate pieces and Italian cinnamon and maybe a couple Maraschino cherries inside.  The shell should be crisp and have a certain doughy cinnamon flavor, but not overpowering.   I don't go for adding alcohol or bits of dried fruit, but that would be an authentic version as well.\n\nRed, White & Brew offers the custard/creme Cannoli with chocolate chips inside (no cherries except for one on top) and the shell is 100% authentic with the Italian cinnamon flavor.  It's something to split with your date.  It's rich like cheesecake and goes quite well with an after dinner coffee or spirits.  I'd jog in place for an hour for one of these, is all I'm sayin'.", "stars": 4}
{"text": "I met a friend here around 11am for coffee and a nosh and it was a pretty busy place with comfortable seating. My amigo got a black coffee and some kind of pastry. I got a cinnamon bagel with cream cheese and a cappuccino. The coffee tasted like a strong French roast, but with calm overtones, not too bitter. Once I tossed some Splenda in there, it was smooth sailing. \n\n(The only reason why I've given Press 4 stars vs. 5 is because I'm an Italian roast person, and wasn't really fond of the coffee flavor overall. The coffee preparation was excellent, with a little heart and extra TLC. No complaints there!)\n\nWe chatted it up for 3 hours. Both of us brought our iPads but I didn't have any Internet connection. He found one but it's name didn't sound official, so I don't think Press offers free Wi-Fi. I'm not 100% sure but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nThe atmosphere was very trendy, North Scottsdale w/a largely Millennial clientele. The staff was friendly and helpful and I'd recommend it if you're in the Scottsdale Quarter and are in need of a strong pick-me-up.\n\nI wouldn't call this place easy on wheelchair/powerchair users.

The sauce was not too heavy nor sweet nor spicy, the coleslaw was perfect and the corn was extremely soft. My rib meat was not falling off the bone, but it was tender.

This year, not so much. \n\nFor my 2017 job of 1 fertilized tree and 2 backyard tree removals/stump grinds, All Pro finally completed everything after a ton of waiting and begging to get on a schedule for each step, so I did not register a complaint with the BBB.  However, it was such a tedious experience, I have to warn people. It took me a ton of work to get them to do what they promised, and with any kind of minimal quality attached.\n\nIn the beginning, I was so happy to see them again for the start of this job!  I had donuts and OJ for the crew!  I enjoyed talking with Dennis; he's very charismatic. By the end, it turned into a crap fest. You just need a ton of patience and to endure the grumpy looks and leers you'll get, all because you want the job done right, all that was promised, and done this year.\n\nThe service caused irrigation leaks (not sure they can help this since they tried after the second tree pull, but be forewarned your water bills could be high), killed plants (other than the ones I was warned about, and they lied about what happened, which wasn't necessary. I'm understanding.), scraped up my concrete walkway (wish I knew, I'd have put a tarp down), and every time I spoke with Dennis or Sue to get to the next step, there was either an excuse or they put words in my mouth that I never said, and it was like working with teenagers.  I was really embarrassed for them.\n\nNOTE: I know all about monsoon damage, flooding and those jobs always come first!!!  My job was not an emergency, and I told them so.  Because they handle HOA's, the bigger jobs, even if they're not emergencies, will just automatically bump you.  And you'll hear all about them.  In detail. More than you care to know. Again, not professional.\n\nI never haggled on price because in 2008, they were so worth what they charged in my book. But in 2017+, you couldn't pay me to call them for help again.

But any main dish worth chowing down on will dig into your calorie purse big time.  And don't get me started on desserts:  The rich and crazy chocolate and raspberry layered cake is nearly 3,000 calories.  The mini size is over 300 calories.  That's just a snack for someone like olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, but for the rest of us that spells diabetic coma. (Tip: Don't broadcast the calorie count of every single menu item.  Most people don't really want to know.)  \n\nThis location has a boomerang-like or half-circle set-up.  I liked it.  The bar was loud on a Friday night, but not crowded.  You're not going to hear your cell phone at all there.  \n\nDrink-wise, I highly recommend the organic green tea, served hot.  That stuff is quality.  Also, their mojitos are fantastic: lots of lemon and mint, very refreshing and not too sweet.  \n\nThere were 6 of us at a huge table and we ate and gabbed for so long that the waiter did a cute little sit down and said hi and then got up quickly and left.  I thought he was being flirty and getting off of his feet for a second, but the more wise and knowing in our group realized he was politely saying \"beat it, we need to feed others.\" (Tip: it's called a lazy susan.  If you have a big group at a round table, you're gonna' see one of these.  We had zero lazy susan skills all night.  I think if you're going to drink, just be prepared to eat someone else's dish, or get dizzy trying to get to yours.)\n\nI'm not a big fan of chains when dining in my home town.  I think chains can make the big, bad scary world of restaurants a teeny more comfy when traveling when you're feeling less adventurous.  But compared to Tempe's PF Chang's location, this one's better and you really can enjoy your meal here.  It's nice to see cars parked there that you will never be able to afford, or take a stroll past tempting shops nearby.\n\nNote: If you are wheelchair bound or in a power chair, the table height at this location is high enough for you to eat like everyone else when seated at the table.

I had to get the Greek Omelette.  It was a three egg omelette with large mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, gyro meat and crumbled feta cheese.  Side options vary from something healthy like cottage cheese to skillet cooked potatoes (\"house fries\"), which were nice.  My eggs were not quite warm enough for my taste, which I think had to do with the fact that we waited quite some time for the food to arrive.

{"text": "Last week, my co-workers and I were in Vegas for a conference and visited Mandalay Bay on Tuesday, May 17 to enjoy dinner and then go see the Michael Jackson One show. \n \nSince many of the full serve restaurants at MB were at capacity, we went to Bayside Buffet.\n \nI have to tell you, this was possibly the worst meal I've ever had in Vegas.  The smell inside the restaurant was putrid, a combination of dirty dishes and mildew.   It seemed to originate around the desserts, where it appears the dishwashing station was located, but permeated throughout the restaurant.  Right then, I wanted to leave and request a refund, but we were out of options since the show was starting in an hour.  \n \nThe food selection and quality was on par with a low-end Hometown Buffet.  Most of the food looked like it was sitting out for a good while, and whenever I ventured to try something, it was bland or just tasted terrible.  \n \nThe best thing there was the soft serve ice cream, which is sad to say.  But to be honest, I never got over the smell so even if the food was decent, I'm not sure I could've enjoyed it.\n \nNormally, I would have shrugged it off but with a price point of over $120 (incl. tax and tip) for 3 of us, I feel like I was truly robbed of my money.  I would've preferred to blow it on Blackjack and gone hungry.\n \nNone of this is something I would have expected for a high end resort.  The staff was friendly but I can't imagine their heart was in it considering the quality.", "stars": 1}

{"text": "Recently visited Merts and was VERRRRY disappointed. The first thing that greeted me when I walked in was the low sanitation score (90) the decor was dark and drab and the fruit flies kept me swatting the moment we walked in the door. As for the food. The collard greens were hard, crunchy and gritty. Quite frankly they were disgusting. They also lacked flavor. I had the Merts appetizer platter. I  noticed the chicken was not properly cooked and the soul rolls were realllly disappointing. I did not like the sweet sauce that they were coated in and they left me with a weird taste in my mouth. Salmon cakes were just ok. But after a under satisfying experience with the other food, it was hard to enjoy anything on my plate. I hope to NEVER visit this place again. If you are in search of soul food, I would look elsewhere. Kings Kitchen is a few blocks away and deliver a much better meal experience and cleaner environment.", "stars": 1}

There was construction being done around the Flamingo, but I called the hotel and they were nice enough to give directions while we were driving. Valet said they were full, the lot said they were full, but we found free parking for not but across the street. Fine. When we walked with all our luggage to to hotel, suddenly valet was open. Clearly some kind of poor communication. I had a bit of a freak out at that point being so tired and hauling everything to the hotel that they went to go get my car for me and park it in valet to make up for the problem. A bell hop helped us the rest of the way and even told us some of the best secret places to see. \n\nWe ate at their dining establishments and got snacks for my conference at their gift shop (overpriced, but whatever, it was better than convention kiosk rates. The outdoor bartender at one of the locations knew a bunch of tricks which resulted in us hanging out there way too long and buying too many drinks. :) Breakfast was huge and delicious. I told the waitress that I was in a bit of a hurry, apologetically, and she made sure to get us our food pretty quickly. Extra tips for her.\n\nWe got the GO room. We liked it. It was affordable and beds were comfy and the rooms were fun. I don't recall the casino or at least the hotel portion smelling too badly of cigarette smoke. Something I just cant stand about Reno or Vegas, which is why we don't spend much time in these locations. I love that the tram is behind the Flamingo.

{"text": "I would give a negative 5 stars if I could. These guys are shysters!\nI drove away really happy after buying my car at showcase last month. I continued to be a happy camper driving around in my new car until about a week after purchasing it when my debit card was declined for a $1 coffee at circle k one morning on the way to work. I called my bank and found out that showcase honda had not only pulled the downpayment for my car but they also helped themselves to an additional large amount of money in a strange denomination that made no sense and essentially wiped out all of my funds. It took me 2 days of calls to the finance department to finally get my money put back into my account only to have another large amount of money in a strange denomination  pulled from my account two days later. They kept saying they had lost the check that I had written them for my down payment ,even though the check had already cleared several days before and the amount they were pulling from my account was not even close to the down payment amount at all! I had not even authorized them to debit my account with my debit card!! I had given them my debit card # to sign up for an automatic deduction of car payments thru another company they use, but the payment wasn'tdue for over 30 days and the amounts they were pulling were not payments they were random amounts that even the finance girl couldn't explain. The finance girls were really snotty with me at first telling me I was wrong until they got a clue and realized they were wrong and then said it would be reversed in 24 hrs. I patiently waited with ZERO funds in my account until the next day and nothing. It took several days to get my money put back into my account and with an explaination of \"we lost your downpayment check\" which had cleared my bank several days earlier and was a very different dollar amount! They declined to pay any over draft fees from my bank even after admitting they made a mistake in pulling the money. Then 2 days later they did it again for a different, unauthorized odd dollar amount that made no sense at all. I ended up having to close the debit card and order another one and my bank suggested I file fraud charges and then close the bank account. I called and left several messages to the \"finance manager\" nearly in tears over what was happening but I never got a return call. I also called the guy who wrote my deal and helped me do all the paper work and he never bothered to call back either. They also sent me plates and didn't bother to credit me the nearly $100 bucks from my old plates that I told them I wanted to keep so I had to spend a few hours at the DMV getting my plates switched over and a credit. They said they would give me credit for the 2+ years left on the service contract of the vehicle I traded in but they blew that off and charged me full price for a new service contract-I found that out when I got the service contract paperwork in the mail yesterday. My salesman called early last week to see how I was loving my new car and I told him what was going on and how upset I was and that the service manager was not returning my calls. The salesman said he would tell the manager and look into it and get back to me. That was a week and a half ago and still not a call back.  Wow, what a dissappointment. I guess they already got my money so why bother investigating my complaints about how SCREWED OVER I was in the process. \nNever again.

{"text": "I would NOT reccomend taking your computer to Data Doctors! I hear there is a small privately owned computer shop on 24th St and indian School that gets great reviews. Data Doctors looked over my laptop for 20-30 mins in the store (20th/Camelback) and then the tech told me he would have to send it to the Tempe main lab for full assessment. $100 to take it in and figure out what the problem is. I got a call 3 days later from someone else stating they just recieved my laptop and were going to look at it the next morning, so apparently it takes them 3 days to send my laptop from downtown Phx to downtown Tempe. The next day I got a call saying they basically have no clue what the issue is but that they are going to reinstall windows and see if that takes care of the problem. That will cost me an additional $200 to reinstall windows!! At this point I feel like I am trapped because I have already spent $100 bucks and they have the computer. I reluctantly agree to basically pay $300 to have windows reinstalled in my 2 year old laptop. When will I get it back? How long could that possibly take, right? Well, 3-5 days he says. it will take 3-5 days to reinstall windows into my laptop and that is \"putting it ahead of 30 other computers for me.\" The guy is now acting like I should feel lucky that he is putting mine ahead of others because otherwise it could take 2 WEEKS?! 2 days later I get a call that it is done and seems to be working just fine. It will be back in the Phoenix store for me to pick up 2 1/2 days later...\nFinally, I get my computer back after 2 weeks and $300. Oh well, at least it is all fixed now, right? WRONG. Now my computer will not connect to my wireless network at home. So I call and talk to my wireless provider for 35 minutes trying this and that and she determines it is my computer that has a problem, not the service. I knew that because the other 4 laptops in the house work fine but I figured maybe it just needed to be reset-up or something. \nI called the Data Doctors store to ask them to help me over the phone with maybe a setting or two. The location I dropped it off at originally has NO RECORD of my laptop ever even coming thru that store and they refer me to call the Tempe lab. I call the Tempe lab and tell two different people my issue before someone decides to help me. They tap into my computer from the lab and look at a few things for 10 minutes and then tell me he thinks it is my wireless connection!! I explain that I have several other computers in the house and that I never had an issue with the wireless component until I got it back from them. He says he does not think it is the computer but I have to take it back to the store to have them try to connect it to their wireless network and go from there...but he does not think it is the computer itself. I have a brand new modem and router.\nWhat a bad experience that still is not over. \nI will never take my computers in to data doctors in the future and I would certainly not reccomend them to anyone else.", "stars": 1}

{"text": "Kumo has to be the best Asian buffet in Northeast Ohio, and you'll find it attracts a lot of Asian families, which is always a good sign.  It's clean, the food is good quality and it's a pleasant setting. We had been partial to Watami, which is also pretty good, but it doesn't have half the selection and variety of Kumo.\n\nThey have a good sized sushi buffet, a tepanyaki station, a crepe station, a Mongolian bbq grill, and three islands of chinesey/japanesy type foods.\n\nThe ambiance is pretty institutional with touches that show the owner is trying to create a feel of class, but not fully achieving it ... for example, the coin operated crane game in the entryway. That's fine, however, because how classy can a buffet be? We're not talking about a Michelin star sort of place.\n\nThe sushi bar offers probably about 20 types of rolls and nigiri, and they also have things like marinated octopus, seaweed salad, kimchee, and other Asian favorites.\n\nThere are three large buffet steam tables, with all the usual Chinese-American suspects: General Tso's chicken, broccoli beef, hot & sour soup, chow mein, etc. They also include the obligatory not-so-Asian fare that seem to be in every Chinese buffet in Ohio, like fried chicken wings, crab legs, fried fish, etc.\n\nDesert is nothing special, a number of small cakes, sliced fruit and a variety of ice creams.\n\nOkay, so you're not going to be bowled away by the food, but there's a good chance you'll enjoy what you select, and if you leave hungry that's more of a statement about you than Kumo.

Even their margaritas aren't too expensive.

{"text": "The food we ate deserves a solid 3-stars; it was exactly what we ordered, tasted as anticipated and was hot and fresh.  But, there is no gastronomic magic or surprise, because, well ... it's a diner.  A solid, reliable, archetypal diner. Food combined with service gets it four stars.\n\nWe chanced upon Michael's for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon; it was about 2:30 p.m.  Admittedly one of the driving factors in trying Michaels was the fact that they were advertising their Friday fish fry, and my partner is a real aficionado of battered & fried fish ... the fact that it was only $8.99 for AYCE was another motivator.\n\nNow the fact that Michael's is in a shopping center with nothing but a lighted sign to indicate that it is at all different from the supermarket or hair salon that occupies the same flat building front does not build confidence at first.  And when you enter and see the flea market artwork of bright colorful kitschy landscapes, or the pastel vinyl booths, or the big screen TVs promoting keno, these may also give you a moment of insecurity.\n\nWe were seated right away by a no-nonsense woman in her mid-50s, with a with a non-specific Eastern European or perhaps Baltic accent.  We never did figure it out.  I thought initially that she was going to be a problem, because she didn't seem that friendly.\n\nAs I looked around I took note that only two other tables that were occupied at this hour.  We were about 30 minutes past the end of any lunch rush there might have been, and the place just seemed dead.\n\nWhen the woman came back to our table, we had already made up our minds about getting the fish fry, but we had a few questions as well.  There were a number of potato choices one could have with the fish, including mashed, home fries, and french fries.  I asked for clarification about what the difference was between their home fries and french fries, and the woman began to explain how they make their home fries.  As she explained - the details are lost because I got the french fries - it became clear that she didn't just work there, but that the restaurant belonged to her family.  She knew how the food was made and she seemed to take pride in the fact that it was \"home made,\" and not from a can or mix.  She seemed to warm up a bit as we talked and she became rather matronly during the remainder of our meal.\n\nA great example of this was their soup.  In addition to the AYCE fish, the meal came with the salad bar and soup as well.  There were two big tureens of soup at the end of the salad bar: cabbage & noodle and New England clam chowder.\n\nMy partner also loves clam chowder, so that was his first stop as soon as we had placed our order.  He had a salad plate in one hand and was about to set it down to fill the soup cup with the ladle, when the waitress/hostess lady appeared at his side and offered to do it for him.  He was going to take the filled cup from her, but she held him off while she set it on a saucer, because, she pointed out, it was very hot and she didn't want him to burn his hand. That's the sort of matronly attention I was referring to earlier.\n\nBack to the soup ... he was quite impressed.  Again, this was not haute cuisine, but it was good clam chowder.  I have to take his word, because I don't eat shell fish, but he said it was a good balance of cream and clammyness, without too much potato and not excessively thick, like many packaged chowders tend to be.  I had the cabbage & noodle soup, and it was fine.  I think it could have used a touch more sweetness, but overall it tasted just dandy.\n\nThe salad bar had most of the usual salad fixings, but it also had a number of prepared salads to choose from: potato salad, cole slaw and macaroni salad.  There were also a few other items which I wouldn't have expected like spiced apple slices and cubes of bread pudding.  Personally, I didn't really care for the potato salad.  I found it bland.  The macaroni salad was uninspiring, but passable.  I quite liked the cole slaw, however; it went well with the fish.\n\nAs we sat down to start noshing on soup and salad, the afternoon crowd started to roll in.  4-5 more tables filled up while we were there, and the hostess/server seemed to know most of the people as regulars.\n\nOur fish came out within about 10 minutes of our ordering.  It was hot and the fish was rather tasty.   The server continued to check back with us at regular intervals, but not too often so as to be obnoxious.\n They fry the fish to order, so when we got seconds, the server asked us how many pieces we wanted and brought it out to us on a separate plate.  I really liked that I could ask for just two more pieces or six more pieces, so that I wouldn't wind up with more than I could eat and waste it.\n\nAll in all, we quite enjoyed Michael's; the food was good; the service was good and the price was good.  We live about 15 miles away from them, but I could definitely see going back on a Friday afternoon for more fish ... but not every week.", "stars": 4}

{"text": "Sokolowski's University Inn epitomizes the reason so many Mid-westerners are fat.  I'm not sure this place could exist in my home-state of California, but I'm sure glad it's here in Cleveland.\n\nAccording to the sign outside, Sokolowski's was established in 1923, but I didn't find it until 2008.  We went here with a group of about 15 grad students from Case Western, and all of us were newbies to this purveyor of Polish fare.  As we entered, we were a little surprised to find that they serve food cafeteria-style.  This was a little disappointing at first, because we had come here in the hopes of having a semi-fancy meal, before heading off to a gala.  However, the Slavic victuals soon put any disappointment out of my head.\n\nThe menu is hand written daily and photo copied on a few dozen pieces of paper that are strewn throughout the restaurant for you to peruse as you move toward the serving area, where you'll get your oversized cafeteria tray and utensils.  Over the course of nearly a dozen dinner-time visits, I have found that you often have to endure a queue that snakes through one of the dining rooms, through the bar and finally to the serving area, with its stainless steel steam trays and chilled desserts.\n\nThe entree offerings change fairly regularly, but there are a few staples it seems, including Polish staples like kielbasa and stuffed cabbage - As one who eschews meat of the porcine variety, I haven't tried a the sausages, but the stuffed cabbage is rather tasty with a tangy tomato sauce, very similar to the one made by my own Jewish grandmother. I have tried a hand full of different dishes there, including Wienerschnitzel, Chicken Paprikash, Prime Rib, Rib Eye Steak, Fried Perch, and a few others.  I always found them quite tasty, but the atmosphere adds to the experience to make the food even more pleasurable than it would be on its own, say if you were to eat the same thing at home.  The walls are a collection of Cleveland and Sokolowski family memorabilia, and the two often overlap.  There are old newspaper clippings and photos, signs and posters, and other assorted stuff that you wouldn't ever think to put on the walls of your own eatery, but here they seem perfectly in order.\n\nMy absolute favorite item there, by far, however, is one of their staple side dishes ... the pierogi.  You will see this repeated by many of my peers throughout the many reviews of Sokolowski's, and deservedly so.  They let you choose two sides with your entree, and more often than not, I get pierogi for both. Every great eatery - from those with Michelin stars to those that serve from a street cart - has to have something that sets them apart, and for Sokolowski's it's the pierogi. They are delicious, tender potato filled pasta that are smothered in sauteed onions and butter.  They are no friend to your arteries, but with each bite they give your tongue a little hug that makes it nearly impossible not to smile like a besotted middle-schooler as you eat them.\n\nThey have other side dishes too, including noodles with cabbage, mashed potatoes, vegetables and others I barely notice.  There's also a salad bar that is included with your meal.  It has rudimentary salad fixings, including a large bowl of chopped lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, etc.  But what I like best about the it is the selection of Eastern European \"salads,\" including thick potato salad, macaroni salad, cucumbers with dill and sour cream, and the pickled beets.  You could make a meal of these and a side of pierogi, and still your arteries would howl with indignance ... I'd still ignore their screams, because it's just that tasty.\n\nWhy only four stars when I like this place so much?  There are a few aspects that detract from the experience: the queuing up & waiting is not the most entertaining way to spend your pre-meal time. Another biggie is their hours of operation.  They aren't open for dinner on weekdays, and on weekends, they close at 9p, which means a dinnertime craving of pierogi on a Wednesday evening must go unmet.\n\nNevertheless, this place wouldn't have been around for almost 90 years if there wasn't something special about it.  Go, eat and enjoy!", "stars": 4}

The the length was fine, but in the gluteal area, she had totally screwed up and it looked horrible.  \n\nI took them back the next day, and tried them on in front of her, and she said that was the best she could do, and that she didn't work on pants like mine very often.  I wasn't sure what she meant by \"pants like mine,\" as they were basic dress slacks. And they were no longer wearable with the crappy work she had done.\n\nI asked for a refund, and was told that they wouldn't do that, because they had done the work I had brought the pants in for.  I said that the work wasn't acceptable if it wasn't wearable, and in so many workds they said I was S.O.L.\n\nI told them that I wouldn't be back, which was disappointing to me, because they are pretty close to where I live, and I like to support local businesses.  Nevertheless I'm done with them, and I hope my tale is a warning to others.", "stars": 1}
{"text": "Asia Plaza is home to our favorite dim sum spot (Li Wah) and our favorite Asian supermarket (Park to Shop), so we were very excited to see the that there was going to be a new restaurant opening in the facility, and we eagerly anticipated the opening of the E 30th Street Cafe.\n\nIn Cleveland, Asian restaurants that cater to the palates of Asian clientele are few, and given the location, we were hopeful this would be a place to add to our repertoire of Asian dining options\n\nThe interior was pleasant enough - it was clean and modern, but that's about where the positive aspect of the dining experience ended.  Things began to head south when our waiter, a youngish Asian man, approached simply reeking of cigarettes and with an oral hygiene issue that would cause fainting spells in most dental professionals.  I should note here that I was dining with my partner who is also Asian, and has more tolerance than I do for the niceties that one is accustomed to in most Western restaurants, and even he was rather disturbed by this waiter.\n\nBecause his English was very challenged, my partner ordered for us in Mandarin.  It was a cold winter day out, so we both decided to go for soup.  I ordered the Hong Kong Style Beef Tendon Soup and he got the Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup.  We also ordered some scallion pancakes, which are a great accompaniment to soups.\n\nThere were only about 3 other tables that were occupied, and it was pretty much exclusively by Caucasians.  Given the light crowd, the wait for food wasn't bad - about 10 minutes, and we entertained ourselves with the cheesy Chinese soap operas that were playing on the big screen TV.\n\nMy soup came out first, accompanied by the order of scallion pancakes.  Immediately I noted a \"off\" smell coming from my soup.  It looked fine, if plain, but it didn't smell right to me.  Shortly thereafter the waiter brought out my partner's soup, and it pretty much smelled the same as mine.  For those who are unfamiliar with Chinese style soups, ours should have been very different, and yet is was as though they threw a few different contents into the same soup broth and called them by separate names.  The broth was bland, virtually transparent and just didn't taste right,  We both tried adding soy sauce, vinegar and other condiments to liven it up, but nothing really served to improve the flavor, or lack thereof, of our respective soups.\n\nFortunately, the scallion cakes were there to cleanse our palates and they tasted just fine, but I did find them to be disappointingly small.\n\nNeither of us finished our soups; it just wasn't worth it. The only saving grace, if you can call it one, is that the prices were pretty low.  The soup was $6.95 each, if I recall correctly, so it was no great financial loss.\n\nI think the E 3th Street Cafe may suffer from an all-too-common Asian restaurant syndrome of trying to be everything to everyone.  The menu included sushi, dim sum, and an array of foods from different Asian countries.  They also had the sickly sweet and goopy Chinese-American foods that no Asian born person would recognize as being part of their culinary heritage.\n\nYou may have noted that the breadth of our food selection was rather limited, but based on what we saw other people order and what we tasted, we both felt confident that additional visits wouldn't change our minds about it.  I don't want to see them fail, and I hope for their sake they learn to focus on the things they do well (not sure what that might be), and drop the ancillary stuff.  Hopefully, someday soon, an Asian friend will come to us and say, \"I found the greatest place for ...\" and then we might give E 30th Street Cafe another chance ... but not without much skepticism.", "stars": 1}

The wait staff know what they're doing and the service is quick.  Portions and prices are good, and the food is consistent in it's goodness.\n\nIt's very crowded on weekends for brunch, but if you get there before 10 a.m., you can usually get a table right away.\n\nI think they make a great short stack of buttermilk pancakes.  I also really like the lemon-ricotta pancake, but I have had a few occasions when that one has come out a little \"goopy\" in the middle; I'm not sure if it has something to do with the ricotta .  I also like their omlettes. \n\nMy partner almost always gets the biscuits and gravy, and he says they are the best he has had in Cleveland so far; not excessively salty and the gravy isn't too thick.\n\n\nYou're not going to leave here having had the best meal of your life, but you're going to get a solidly good breakfast, and unless you eat a lot more than I do - and I can eat a lot  - you'll leave fully sated.", "stars": 4}
{"text": "When the best thing one can say about a restaurant is that the food didn't make you sick, it shouldn't be considered a reason to try it out for yourself.  As one previous reviewer said, this is just bad American-Chinese food.\n\nWe ordered from here because we were feeling lazy and we wanted delivery that wasn't pizza.  Golden Dragon is close to home, and we figured that it wouldn't take too long for the order to arrive.\n\nWe ordered our usual new Chinese restaurant test menu, Beef Chow Mein and General Tso's chicken ... these are pretty easy dishes that are hard to mess up.  We also ordered a Tofu with Garlic Sauce.  The menu also said that you could get a free order of fried rice with purchase of $20 or more, and here is where things started to go south.  The guy on the phone told us that they don't offer the fried rice any more, but he would give us two cans of soda instead ... and the soda selections were Mountain Dew, Grape, Orange and others we didn't even recognize.  We passed on the soda.  It reminded me of Homer Simpson when his car was booted at the World Trade Center and the surly \"khavalch\" vendor only offered a beverage choice between Mountain Dew and Crab Juice; of course Homer chose the Crab Juice, wouldn't you?\n\nTo their credit, the delivery time wasn't bad.  The food however, was less than mediocre.  It was hard to tell the difference between the three items, by appearance, taste and texture.  My partner, being Chinese, was offended that this was being passed off as the food of his people.  Adding insult to injury, he was infuriated by Golden Dragon's version of chow mein - the word chow mein in Chinese means \"Fried Noodle\" and if you've ever ordered it in a semi-passable Chinese restaurant, you probably remember vegetables and meat poured over a bed of crispy pan fried noodles.  This is not to be confused with lo mein, which are also noodles covered with vegetables and meat, but in lo mein, the noodles aren't fried crispy.  \n\nSo the Golden Dragon version of chow mein was a brown mush of beef bits and a mass of soggy bean sprouts.  When we opened it up, we couldn't figure out where the noodles were, and I went so far as to wonder out loud if maybe they were using bean sprouts instead, or maybe they even forgot to include the noodles - as we were having this discussion, I was munching on a small bag of crispy wonton skin like you might add to a bowl of hot and sour soup; I figured this was some little complimentary munchy thing they included with all their orders.  You can probably see where this is going ... it was just then that the reality of the situation became clear to me and I understood that these stupid little wonton skin strips were supposed to be the fried noodles for the chow mein.  I told my partner what I just realized and he was incredulous - he spent about three minutes telling me that was impossible, because it was the antithesis of chow mein.  He ultimately felt the need to call Golden Dragon and verify that this was the case ... he spent a few minutes speaking with the guy in English trying to say that there were no noodles with the dish and explaining that these wonton skins were not noodles.  Suddenly he switched to Mandarin and a torrent of loud invective poured out as he sought clarification in a language the guy on the phone might understand.  \"How can you even consider yourself Chinese,\" my partner said to the guy?!  \"Your food brings shame to your family and all Chinese people.\"  There was more than that, but I thought it was the most telling part.\n\nNeedless to say, we tossed most of it and we were out $23.  My advice, steer clear.", "stars": 1}
{"text": "Wonton Gourmet is one of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, and the majority Asian clientele would seem to agree. It's a rather small restaurant, with an austere ambiance. There are probably 20 or so tables, mostly 2 and 4-tops, but there are a few larger round tables that can sit 6-10 people.\n\nThey have two menus: one for the non-Asians with most of the \"typical\" American-Chinese dishes like sweet and sour shrimp, General Tso's chicken, and eggrolls; and one that is all written in Chinese, which includes items most of us white folk wouldn't know about, and that might push some of our limits for what we feel comfortable eating, like frog, pig intestine, or beef tendon. Please note, my previous statement is not a judgement of Chinese food, but more of a remark on the somewhat limited palate of the \"average\" American.  I feel I should note that I happen to like beef tendon.\n\nI would recommend avoiding the more typical American-Chinese dishes. You can find those in any Chinese restaurant in Ohio, and Wonton Gourmet doesn't do anything special with them.  If you can read Chinese, or find a friend who does, try exploring the \"real\" menu.\n\nWe go here once or twice a month, and I'm fortunate that my partner reads Chinese, so we have access to both menus. This is helpful, because although they have a lot of their menu spread out across the walls of the restaurant with color photos of the dishes, it's hard to know what's in many of them, beyond their names.  For example, \"Hong Kong style noodle soup,\" doesn't provide much insight, other than the fact it's a noodle soup that is typical of the former UK colony.\n\nI have had a few mediocre dishes there. I happen to feel that the HK Style soup is bland and not worth the calories. I also had a beef and vegetable low mein that was flavorless. But for the most part, I have enjoyed their food. They have a great beef and tendon stew in a clay pot, a deliciously rich bamboo and mushroom sautee, a wonderfully crispy wok-fried chow mein, and many others.\n\nDon't expect to be bowled over by ambiance, customer service or presentation, but overall, if you're interested in exploring authentic regional Chinese cuisine, you'll probably have a good time.  You should also be aware that it gets very busy for brunch/lunch on the weekends - they serve some traditional Chinese breakfast foods, not typical brunch fare that you'll find at an American restaurant - so if you go between 10:30A and 1P, there could be a wait.", "stars": 4}

But the people who work here are good at what they do; they come to recognize you if you're a regular and they start your food before you even get to the counter. Also, for the most part, they are a friendly and up-beat crowd.\n\nOne thing I appreciate as well, is that they do a great job of slicing your bagel, so that both halves are pretty much the same size.

{"text": "I first heard about this place from Cleveland Magazine's 2010 edition that focused on Cleveland's best diners.  We decided to check it out on a Saturday morning at about 10 a.m. \n\nThe address is on Lorain, but consider parking on a side street to avoid the metered spaces out in front of the restaurant.  We parked on the north side of Lorain, because it seemed to be a slightly better neighborhood than on the south side, and only had to walk a quarter of a block to the front door.\n\nWe were lucky when we got there, because there was just one open table and it was a two-top. Actually there seemed to be a charmed quality to the morning, because the place was continually full, but it seemed like every time a party walked in, one of the tables would finish up and leave ... no one ever seemed to wait more than 2-3 minutes before they got a table.\n\nThe ambiance of the place was interesting.  As for the decor, it looked a little schizophrenic.  One side of the restaurant is sort of an industrial-80s homage, while the other side is a neo-graffiti mural of a Japanese-style monster attacking Cleveland.  It almost seemed like there were two owners who each got to choose the decoration for their side of the room.  The crowd was incredibly diverse for Cleveland.  There were a few families with kids, while at another table there were a group of bikers, and at another was a table of gentlemen of three different ethnicities. It was a mix of different races, economic groups, ages, and social statuses.\n\nThe service was pretty quick.  We had a very attentive waitress who welcomed us and informed us that the restaurant had been in the newspaper that morning, and told us that she'd bring us the article to read.  We found this charming, although we didn't really care so much about reading the review.\n\nThe menu is extensive and the prices are surprisingly low.  We took advantage of the the economical options to try out a few extra dishes.\n\nI ordered the \"Three Eggs with Two Sausage patties, hashbrowns andtoast\" for only $4. I also ordered a side of three pancakes FOR $3.50.\n\nMy partner got the \"buiscuits and gravy\" which came with three eggs, and hashbrowns, for $5. He also got a side of corned beef hash for $2.50.\n\nOverall the food was just fine; it's exactly what you expect from breakfast food at a diner. My critique is that nothing was extraordinary.  \n\nThe eggs were done very well.  Mine were scrambled, and were fluffy, without being too moist or too dry.  My partner had his over easy, and they were perfection.  The pancakes were light and very hot, which made them perfect for soaking up the butter.  There were a few minor disappointments though. The hashbrowns were mushy, without any real crust to them.  I think they were frozen potato strips that were kept on the griddle for too long without enough oil to make them crisp.\n\nThe gravy for the biscuits was a little underwhelming, and may have come ready made.  The corned beef hash also seemed like it was from a can. Again, it tasted okay, but these are simple dishes that can be done easily and well from scratch.\n\nI mentioned before that the waitress was very attentive; unfortunately, the kitchen was a somewhat slow.  Despite the delay, the waitress did an amazing job of keeping our coffee full, and letting us know about where things stood in the kitchen.  While we would have liked our food about 10 minutes sooner than we got it, the customer service more than made up for the delay, and she waitress could hardy have done a better job of making sure we knew we had not been forgotten.\n\nOverall we really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back.", "stars": 4}

When we asked the waitress about the food, She politely said that it was coming, I personally dont think it was her fault at all, it was more the kitchen and the manager on duty. The waitress said it was coming and went to the kitchen to check upon the order, we also heard her say to the kitchen crew \"why is table 22's ticket not on the screen\", she was arguing with the kitchen crew and they replied that maybe it had \"Expired\". We asked another waitress for our table number and she said it was 22, so we quickly realized that it was our ticket and food that was missing and thats why we never received the food, we call the waitress and ask her to please explain what was going on, she said that the ticket was not on file but that they were going to make it right away, which I replied politely to speak to the manager. I just wanted an explanation since the restaurant was not even full, and i saw employess just walking around. When the manager came to our table (she is Caucasian) all I said was that \"I been waiting for more than an hour with 2 small kids that need to be fed, I told her that I didnt understand why it was taking so long to make our food, she replied and said I dont really know whats going on, or what happened, all I can tell you is that it seems like your order got lost, I was really dissapointed by this time that all I said is I would like the total for my drinks and that way I can go somewhere else\", and her reply was \"its nothing, good bye! and yelled to the kitchen STOP making the FOOD!. She never apologize or never even cared to try to find a appropriate explanation. When we got up and were walking out and the table behind us, said that the waiting time was ridiculous, and that they waited about the same. The table across us, a family with 4 small kids also got up and left when we left.\n\n I rarely write reviews, but I think this experience has been one of the worst Ive been in so it deserves to be shared and maybe they can fix whatever they are lacking in. This store just opened for more than 6 months, and should not be having this kinds of problems. They need better managing skills, someone who is professional and someone who at least cares for costumer service when its needed.", "stars": 1}

I also told them that my 2 big toes were messed up and clearly those were my fault but I stated that I would pay to get them fixed.

First, I only received a trail pair of contacts instead of the two boxes I was supposed to receive because they messed up the initial order. After another month of not receiving my two boxes of contacts I called to inquire and after waiting a few days after being told I would receive a call from one of the staff, which I never did, called back again and learned that my contacts had been sent back because they were never picked up. I never received a message that my contacts were available. They then told me that they would be reordered and available for pickup the next week. So the next week I called and was told that the order had not placed because they didn't know how many boxes I wanted, even though from the original order it was always two boxes.

{"text": "**TIMESHARE SCAM HOTEL**\n\nThis resort is such a joke! How can you call yourself a \"five star gold crown\" resort if both the interior and exterior design is disgustingly hideous?\n\nI found out about this resort through a timeshare scam while walking through the Excalibur with my fiance on the Strip. We were approached by a \"Take a Break Travel\"  representative claiming he can offer us 90% off show tickets. The rep advised us that we will be able to purchase the discounted tickets with one catch, to attend a timeshare presentation for two hours maximum, breakfast included. As we had nothing to do the following morning, we decided to attend the presentation for the discounted tickets.\n\nThe next morning, we arrived at the Excalibur and checked in for the timeshare presentation and was shuttled to the Grandview Resort with a bunch of guests who were also \"scammed\" into this presentation. After stepping in to the so called \"resort\" I was turned off immediately with the disgusting red interior and the doctor's office feel of the entrance and check in lobby area. You call this a 5 star? Really?? After a few minutes, we were  assigned to a salesperson to lead us through the time share presentation. That complimentary breakfast consists of stale pastries, cheap coffee, dispensed water and paper plates.. Again.. you call this  5 star breakfast??\n\nBefore touring the resort, I advised the salesperson that I am only here to get my discounted tickets and will attend the timeshare tour and presentation of this resort but will not purchase a timeshare. Salesperson confirmed that it will not be a problem and that we will not be pressured into purchasing a timeshare. \n\nWe started off walking out of the resort and entering the casino next door. The casino next door has a bowling alley, bar, arena, pool, theater, etc. Who cares.. still not five star presentation. We then continued to tour the whole property and may I say that after walking in to the different buildings of the property, we were not greeted once by their hotel staff? Thats a 0 Star service resort in my opinion. We then toured the rooms and the rooms looked decent BUT is most likely all \"staged\"\n\nAfter the whole tour, we were given a lecture on the history of the resort and Vegas and salesperson talked about the options of purchasing. The salesperson was so pushy and will not take \"no\" for an answer. After numerous attempts declining the timeshare sales, the salesperson's \"manager\" came over and gave us another offer. A no is a no and I do not care how low you will offer. Apparently English must be their second language because they simply do not understand what \"no\" is and kept pushing and making up excuses to make us purchase.\n\nHow can you offer a timeshare at this location for $29K, dropped to $27K, then to $21K finalizing it at $11K. Who will be that dumb and desperate to sell like that? \n\nLong story short, we did not buy the timeshare and will never step foot into this dump ever again. We did however get our tickets so in the end, we win and they lose. I forgot to mention that the salesperson  clarified that she is not associated with Take a Break Travel and Take a Break Travel is just who their company hires for marketing. BS because in the end, the person giving us our discounted tickets were from Take a Break Travel. To the salesperson, do yourself a favor and find a real job. \n\nPlease take my advice and pass on the timeshare. If you insist of attending it anyway for the discounted tickets, attend the timeshare but promise me to play along with the salesperson, get them all excited but in the end don't even give them a penny.", "stars": 1}

I ordered the #2 combination plate (burrito, Mexican rice, beans and a bev), since it has rice, and how bad can one foul up rice? We waited a while, and drank our drank. Finally, our order was ready and we got our tray (apparently, more than one tray is not allowed?)\nRemember my mentioning of my delicate constitution? Well, I was eating my burrito, and for some reason, I had major intestinal distress. Imagine being a passenger on an airplane and the captain calling in an in flight emergency, it was THAT BAD. I don't know what it is with me and Mexican food, but I needed to vacate my bowels desperately. Luckily, no one was using the (unisex, ugh GROSS!) bathroom, so I quickly excused myself and made it in time.\nNow, I was only there for a few minutes, but let me tell you, I believe I saw whole galaxies born and die within that short time frame. The horns that tore down the walls of Jericho could not have reached my ears, with the amount of blood pounding within. I thought I was developing Parkinson's by the amount of uncontrollable shaking.\nAnd then it stopped.\nI finished my bathroom routine, washed my hands (because I'm a gentleman), readjusted myself in the mirror and rejoined my friends. They asked if I was doing well, since they mentioned that I \"looked as haggard as a $5 trick in NYC during Fleet Week.\" I lied, because the staff was looking over at our table, and said that whilst swallowing, something went the wrong way. I did ask if they would mind trying out some of my burrito, so everybody took a bite and deemed it was fine. So, I figured it must be psychosomatic or something, and continued to eat.\nRemember I mentioned fouling up rice? Let me tell you about the rice. Bland little kernels of heated material. Being edible is one thing, but actually trying to put it down is another. Luckily, the grease from the burrito was abundant, so that after a futile amount of gnawing, it could slide down.\nNotice how I didn't mention anything about the beans? Between the rice and beans, the rice was manna from Heaven. Discuss.\nI decided to continue on with my rapidly congealing burrito. Now mind you, my friends and I are there, chillaxing, talking and eating. So, a bite of the burrito and a swig of the mop water (Pepsi, if you need to know), and conversation. Bite and swig. Bite and swig.\nHello! Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I made it on time once more, and this time I thought I was passing a Toyota. Not a Yaris, but a fully tricked out Avalon XLE Touring Sport Edition. I sweat to God, if I had gripped that metal stabilization bar in the bathroom any harder, I would have left handprints.\nI feel sorry for tearing this place down, since I know that the staff is following recipes that they can't deviate from. The staff aren't at fault at all. It's just that something within the recipes themselves makes their food as welcome farting in a crowded elevator. What is it with me and ethnic food?\n\nTL,DR: Between 1) eating Mexican (in this case, Roberto's) or 2) kissing the meth heads north of the Strip full on the lips, 5 full seconds of contact, a litle bit of tongue?

The cool thing is that this restaurant is located in the Fashion Show Mall, so I can window shop.\n\nThe pizzas were a good size, we ordered three large pies. 1) The classic Margherita 2) White pizza (no tomato sauce) with garlic and mushrooms 3) Tomato sauce based pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and olives\n\nAll pizzas were good, with a thin crust and not too soggy. My personal favorite was the white pizza. So simple yet very flavorful! I wouldn't say this is the best pizza I have ever had but it's definitely something you should try.\n\nExpect your experience to be quick, we ordered the pizzas and were in and out in less than an hour. You'd have to expect a quick dining experience especially if a line is waiting outside.", "stars": 4}

So in total, we tipped Miss Brookelynne $30!  We leave and get in the car and I see that I have a friend request from our Waitress, Miss Brookelynn. I thought it was odd, so I ignored it.  Not 2 minutes later I see a Facebook post that she tagged me in, I open it to see that this waitress POSTED A PICTURE OF JUST MY SIGNED RECIEPT (signature and FULL name included) the posts says \"We don't tip $2 on a $50 tab (my name)\".

The house was a bit beat up as it was around 10 years old, but since we were just leasing the property, we took it as is.  BIG MISTAKE!!  We moved out to relocate out of state, and were charged for the damages to the home that already existed when we moved in.  Moreover, we were charged twice for cleaning due to pets.  The property managers never gave us an entry for the gate as they promised they would, and seemed to care more about their personal vacations then they did about the property we were leasing.  Once we got someone new to be the contact, the only time we saw her was the final walk through, and she seemed more interested in the house next door that was for sale than she was about our property.  Although we enjoyed the time we lived in the property, the move out experience and the charges that followed were horrific!  I would NEVER lease from this company again.

They had some other Italian appetizers as well, ie. rolled deli ham and cheese cubes. \n\nThe hot plate section was not labeled and it took an explanation from the young host in order for us to know what the dishes were. The Chicken Cacciatore and Cheese Balls were incredible :) \n\nMain course: As the first round of meats arrived, you can tell that they were made very recently. We received italian sausage, grilled pineapple, garlic bread, pork rib, grilled chicken, and top sirloin. They were up to par in taste and served from a hot skewer and the portions were fair.  We never received any tri-tip, leg of lamb, or filet mignon - all of which are advertised on their groupon/website! \n\nThe highlight of our underwhelming experience was the warm smile and friendly attitude from the head chef and his staff. \n\nIn all honesty, the groupon price we paid ($65 incl tip) is still a pretty high for what we received.", "stars": 1}

I have been going to Halfshell for years and my most recent experience left me questioning if it would be my last. My best friend scheduled their engagement party there weeks before the event night.  She confirmed the details with a manager several times. She showed up, no tables were ready or blocked off, people were sitting in the section that She had paid money to reserve and our friends had to ask them to move! Our friends felt guilty so they sent the people a bucket of beers. That is the job of Halfshell/Beachhouse dont you think? Strike 1. We move on to order drinks. It says fully stocked bar. Ya right. Only if you bring your own! This place was out of everything we tried to order, then the bartender, Jared, informed us he could make the shots we wanted because his friend brought a bottle of Jagger because thats what he drinks. Strange?  Definitely.  Strike 2. The service for the party was awful. We had one waitress for a party of 30 (again this party was booked for weeks) and kept being told they were under staffed.. Ummmmm Shouldnt they have prepared well in advance for it? Strike 3. And my last and final straw was with them over charging my credit card by $13! Our total for the night was $21. We left a $6 tip bringing the amount I signed on my credit card tab $27. I usually check credit cards within a couple days after going to a restaurant for this reason but it was a busy week. I checked yesterday. The card was ran for $40! When I very politely called and spoke to the manager, Erin, she was very apologetic and nice and assured me they would make it right. Offered a gift card. I politely declined (knowing it will be a very long time before I go back here again) and asked to come pick up my cash instead. Her excuse is what bothered me most... sometimes wrong numbers get pressed. 4 and 0 are nowhere near 2 and 7 on the screen! My opinion is that this happens often and they hope people don't notice or call to correct it. If the service hadn't been so crappy and the bar HAD been fully stocked like it should be on a friday night when they know a large party is scheduled, I probably wouldn't have called either.

Just seemed really odd, like they have only been trained in selling and not actually fitting, but for me glasses are not a luxury they are basically a prosthetic, i cannot function without them.... maybe I've just been really lucky for the last 38 years and had above average eye care professionals...

{"text": "Really a 4.5, but I'm rounding down.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for lunch. I was initially surprised by the decor. I'm visiting PGH for the first time, and Park Bruges doesn't look like any other place I've been to so far in PGH. It's modern-ish and I loved it. The staff seemed really relaxed. We were seated immediately, as we were arriving for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. There were about 5 or 7 other tables with customers.\n\nWe were given water immediately, and our waitress seemed nice enough. He ordered the Bruges burger, I the grilled veggie melt (I can't remember the name and it's not on the menu on the website), and we shared an order of Bruges frites.\n\nThe fries were perfectly salted, but soggy. One of the reasons why it's not 5 stars. They weren't greasy soggy, just soggy. I also like my french fries piping hot, and these weren't burn-your-mouth-hot, so not ideal for me. The roasted garlic dijon mustard that comes with the fries in delish though! I plan on recreating it at home.\n\nMy boyfriend says the burger is the best burger he's ever had. The bun to meat ratio is fantastic, and the bun is perfectly toasted. The patty was juicy (as witnessed by me, because it was dripping juices onto his plate) but the bun didn't get soggy at all. As a vegetarian, even I thought the burger looked amazing.\n\nMy veggie sandwich was amazing. As silly as it sounds, a good/well made grilled veggie sandwich is hard to come by. Often times the bread will not stand up well to cooked vegetables, and water from the vegetables will drip all over the place. The sandwich has arugula (my fave), grilled zucchini, roasted peppers, tomatoes, feta, hummus, and maybe some other things I can't remember. It was all on a perfectly toasted ciabatta bread. It was crispy enough to hold up to the vegetables, but not so hard that it cuts the roof of your mouth when you bite into it.\n\nMy biggest complaint about lunch was the slaw that came with the burger and sandwich. I still haven't figured out what was off about it, but it was not tasty. I seemed oily, and kind of flavorless. With that being said, the sandwich and burger more than made up for a sub optimal coleslaw.", "stars": 4}

My boyfriend, however, ordered their ten and absolutely loved it, so I suppose it just depends on if you're a weenie or not. Either way, Sun's Thai Food and Jerky was a delicious spur-of-the-moment choice and we will definitely be going back.", "stars": 4}

The selection of microbrewed bottles is pretty extensive, and certainly better than the selection you'll find anywhere else Downtown.

{"text": "I used to live by Rock-n-Roll fingers about two years ago, and even though I moved downtown, I still find myself drawn back to this place.  The concept is simple - pretty much just chicken, and a few other sides you'd expect from a chicken place.  Only thing is, their chicken is amazing.  Based on the fingers alone, I would say I haven't had better in AZ.  The best part is that they always seem to make them up fresh when you order.  This results in a little bit of a wait (5-10 minutes), but having fresh chicken fingers is worth it for me.  As far as sauces, I tend to go with the House sauce.  It's a little bit like a Remoulade sauce - not really sure what it's made out of, but it works well with the fingers.\n\nThe only negative to this place is really just a comparison to itself.  When they first opened up, they had unbelievable waffle fries.  Unfortunately, somewhere along the line they decided to go with regular fries.  The ones they switched to aren't BAD, but compared to the waffle fries they just don't cut it.  If they switched back to waffle fries I would definitely bump to 5 stars.", "stars": 4}

EVERYTHING is half off during happy hour (4-6PM).  The seafood sampler, for example, is normally around $27 and can be had for half price.  Most places with \"half price\" specials normally have stipulations that you can't order certain things.  Kincaid's doesn't do this and it's one of the hidden gems around here in my opinion.  As far as happy hour drinks go, they are something like $1 off for beers, and a cheaper price for certain drinks.  The cranberry mojito is actually really good here too.\n\nNow, as far as the dining experience goes, it's almost overwhelmingly positive in my experience.

I would have previously considered myself a loyal patron of the Roosevelt, but after tonight I am done for good.  Let me preface this story by saying that I arrived last night (a Thursday) JUST before a brutal storm hit.  A bunch of us were literally trapped in the Roosevelt as the storm went on outside.  The air conditioning cut off , but eventually the storm subsided and the power came back on.  At that point, I was somewhat happy that I was no longer trapped in a small, sweaty house, so I grabbed a refill and started talking to my friends.  As I was talking, I felt a tap on my shoulder, and I turned around to hear the owner telling me to \"be quiet, we can't hear the music,\" referring to the exceedingly mediocre folk rock act that had started performing in the front area.  Now, I love live music, and I have no problem with giving the performers an appropriate place to play, but after sitting through a storm for an hour and sticking around for some drinks, I would expect to actually be allowed to speak.

I was sadly disappointed, not once but twice within a two and a half month timeframe.  In the latter part of the month of May, my wife and I decided we'd try the Summerlin restaurant.  The restaurant was very busy and we decided we'd dine in the bar area.  There appeared to be confusion of who would be our server and once he was identified we only saw him one time afterward.  Drinks, place settings, bread, the entrees, and desserts were served by five individuals, who consistently stated someone else would be bringing the next drink or food item.  We had to go to the bar to request refills of water, after our \"temporary\" server indicated she would be back with water and never returned.  The food was acceptable and the Rigatoni \"D\", my favorites, was as served at the Fashion Show location.  We waited approximately fifteen minutes for our check, then I asked the bartender to send our server over so that I could pay the check.  The last server apologized for the delays as the restaurant was busy.\n\nOn June 16, 2017, I decided to again give Maggiano's my business thinking the past experience was an anomaly.  Sadly, that was the case.  The first comment the server made to me was that \"we're very busy\".  I know now that is Maggiano's code for be prepared to have poor service.  Once again, service was greatly lacking.  When the server recommended a number of alcoholic beverages and I indicated our table does not drink alcohol, his facial expression was a combination of disappointment and contempt.  He did make recommendations regarding appetizers and entrees.  My party was satisfied with their food selections.  I again ordered the Rigatoni \"D\", which was the worst I'd ever ordered.  The temperature of the dish was inconsistent and the chick breast was tough.   The desserts were excellent.  My wife ordered an expresso and when it was delivered, after a lengthy wait, it was cold.  When brought to the attention of a staff member, a hot expresso was provided.  Again, after a wait of approximately fifteen minutes the check was presented.\n\nAfter two negative experiences at this restaurant, I cannot in good conscious recommend this restaurant to my friends and acquaintances.

The woman who schedules offers all sorts of half truths to cover for the fact that it is a joke to schedule anything. She says 3-4 weeks out to schedule.

Well when I offered to drive in to their office and have her picked up from there - Guess what?? Still no drivers available.  \n\nAdditionally, because they don't have driver's schedules beyond the 7 weeks or so, I wasn't even able to get on the schedule ahead of time. Instead she told me to keep calling back on the off chance that a driver turns in his schedule. When she finally got frustrated enough with me she offered two dates. I took them, scheduled the times and everything. 1 week before the first drive I checked the website and the dates were not listed. When I called to enquirer suddenly those dates were tentative. What??? Now there was no way to get 4 drives in before May 9th.  She was pleased and quick in giving me a refund, as I could tell from her cranky attitude that she was done with me.

I explained to one of his staff who makes the appointments what a problem it was to have to have my husband put on a gurney and transported to his office and could he please get them the next day when he gets the procedure done.  She put me on hold and came back and insisted he come in both days.  I then asked why the Dr  was being such a jerk for not having any compassion for my husband.  It made no sense at all to make him come on a gurney both days. The next day the nasty assistant who thinks that she is a doctor herself called him which happened to be the day before the procedure and told him that the Dr would no longer see him, wouldn't do the procedure, and he would have to find himself a new Dr because I called him a jerk.  Who does that? There were other ways of handling the situation and to take it out on my husband was gross negligence.  We have since seen another Dr who cannot believe that Dr Fishell let his legs get so bad without recommending some kind of physical therapy.  In June it will be a year since all this started.  He no longer has any muscle in his legs and his new Dr said it would take well over a year to work on him getting any muscle back to walking order if he even can ever walk again.  Dr Fishell and his snotty assistant Annette ought to be ashamed of themselves.  I suspect there's a lot of cattiness going on in that office and Annette is a big part of the problem too.  She has about as much compassion as a nut.  Dr Fishell only worries about being sued.  Well guess what Dr?  You're probably going to be sued anyway. If you are on workman's comp and only care about getting strong medication and you're not paying for them then you are a candidate for this useless Dr. But if you indeed have a problem that needs to be addressed don't go to this man.  All he cares about is your  $200 visit every month without having to do any work. The star rating I selected was a 1 star, ,but he shouldn't even be rated that.  He isn't worthy of even a 1.", "stars": 1}

The latte I had was SUPERB and I would definitely return for that. \n\nThe Benedicto was okay. The sides (salad and potato hash) were not fresh, the hollandaise was a little too lemony and the eggs were a little over-done.

The shrimp chips were bland.\n\nDessert: Pavlova + lemon curd - I enjoyed this the most, and I'm not overly excited by dessert. The lemon curd with citrus salad (blueberry & tangerine) was amazing and the sugary pavlova was perfect with it.\n\nAnd to drink, I tried the \"Raspberry Balsamico\" mocktail.

{"text": "Well after eating so many times at this place I decided to finally write a review.\n\nThe good: I usually go to this Robertos for a late night snack, trough the drive thru  and order the Carne Asada Fries,  more bang for your buck, with taxes it comes out to $8.63. Now i'm a picky eater so I only get the fries, Carne Asada, and the cheese.  It  always taste great and the people working the drive trough are always courteous. \n\nThe bad: The only thing i periodically dislike is that I don't think they have a set standard of how much stuff they put on your plate/container. Usually I'll get lucky and get great amounts of Carne Asada, Cheese and Fries. A couple of times though the guy making them (it's always a guy) gives me good amounts of beef but will skimp out on the fries and the Cheese. I llike my cheese! lol. \n\nThe ugly: I think the owner is hella (west coast slang there) cheap. Since we started visiting this Robertos, the drive true speaker has been broken. You usually can't understand the person taking the order, and many times the person taking the order has told us to drive directly to the window were you pay to take our order. I think I've visited 15 times this year, and it still hasn't been fixed.  Also I dislike the whole \" pay one extra dollar to use a debit/credit card\" their website says they have 65 locations total, I think they can go without that extra \"one dollar fee/surcharge\" \n\nI would have given the \"taco shop\" a five if it wasn't for the chepness and the irregularity of the carne asada to cheese to fries ratio. The taste of the food and the service does give them a solid 4 in my book. I still recommend this place.", "stars": 4}

There are too many companies out there that will appreciate your business, keep you posted about your belongings and care about providing good customer service.\n\nSo many issues, no consistency, poor communication and no solutions. Told belongings would be stored in a warehouse in same state we were moving to(even went as far to give us an address, name and number to manager of storage place) but belongings ended being stored in the state we moved from. At least we thought; the driver of the truck stated that he picked the items up in a completely different state. \n\nChanged delivery date on us three times. Which made it very difficult to schedule other moving help. Their mentality is, \"We've got your stuff so not our problem\". \n\nMultiple items broken.

No. He mumbled his way through the official things he needed to say.  He was definitely hard to hear so I had to ask him to repeat himself numerous times. Not very hospitable if you ask me. He didn't even tell me his name, or at least that he wasn't the guy going to give me the tattoo.\n\nOnce that was over, Eric,  the actual artist, came over and we discussed the location and price of the tattoo. I quikcly felt at ease - that he cared about what he was doing. \n\nThe tattoo itself took about an hour. Eric did a great job. He wasn't overly chatty or awkwardly silent. I felt cared for as he asked every now and then how I was doing. Everything was clean and he was very careful.\n\nI loved what he did - it looks exactly how I hoped it would.

{"text": "I will NEVER, I repeat, NEVER shop at a Soma store again in my life.  Not only that, but I will make sure that none of my friends or family will shop here either.  This is my second time shopping at Soma, both horrible experiences.  Let's start with today's experience:  I go in with my mother, both of us needing new bras.  Not only did the sales associates treat us like absolute garbage (I will leave your mind to wonder as to why), but were not helpful at all.  When I asked the sales associate multiple times to assist my mother, she kept saying \"one moment\" and then would disappear to the back, return, and then decide to help whoever else had walked in.  Now, onto the second associate that was helping me:  This is my second encounter with this girl running the cash register, and both times I am short changed or improperly checked out only to notice once I get home.  In today's incident, I purchased $250 worth of merchandise and wanted to use the $25 off of $125 coupon.  I did not notice until my return home that she used the $15 off instead after insisting that she used the right one.  Now, to my first visit into Soma about a month ago:  I worked with the same above cashier and a woman named Gail/Gale.  Gail/Gale was completely rude, pushy, and made it clear that unless you were spending over a $100 (which I was) that she could care less about helping you.  And god forbid you look at clearance or the 2 for $59 bras while Gale is working.  Now to the cashier.  She short changed me.  I gave her $105 in cash for a purchase that was $101.75 (approximately), and I did not realize until I went to my car that I only received a quarter back.  Soma is obviously a company that pushes their employees to make hasty, hurried sales while cheating their customers out of money.

And the song was very special to my husband and his parents- it was Edelweiss. What we wanted for the bridal party was the more fun, bridal party-appropriate, \"I'm Yours\" by Jason Mraz.

There was not even so much as an \"I'm sorry we forgot to play 1 of your songs.\"\n\nWhen you hire people to play 4 songs, and they only play 3, that is a HUGE problem in my book.

Unfortunately, STRIPBURGER is not one of them.  \n\nI ordered a beer, burger and fries as I sat at the bar.  The food was fine.  Not terrible.  Not phenomenal.  I would say acceptable. A little pricey, but everything on the LV strip tends to be a bit higher priced so no major surprises there.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the bartender gives my bill.   I submit my $15 off a $30 purchase coupon to her.  She rings the transaction on the cash register, I pay and she gives me my receipt. Right before I left, I told the bartender I would be back for another beer after I did some shopping in the adjoining mall.  \n\nOne hour later, I returned. I sat at the bar again with the same bartender.  I ordered another beer.  The price is $11.00 plus tax.  I lay my $10.00 off any purchase coupon on the bar along with two single $1.00 bills.  In Las Vegas, NV the state sales tax equals 8.1% of your total purchase price.  On an $11.00 purchase, the sales tax equals approximately .89 cents.  So the total of my beer should be $11.89.  This is where things start getting dicey. \n\nThe bartender picks up my two single dollar bills along with my $10.00 coupon.  She immediately places the two $1.00 bills in her tip bucket.  She then proceeds to lay my $10.00 coupon on the top of her till drawer on the cash register and she completely fails to ring my beer purchase on the cash register.  I get no change and no receipt.  Meanwhile, the bartender has three separate girlfriends who visit her, on three separate occasions during my visit.  The bartender seems to be more interested in jawboning with her girlfriends then paying attention to doing her job and taking bar orders.  At one point, a gentleman on the other side of the bar actually yells ''Excuse me Miss, may I order a drink''.\n\nBy this point, I decide I am going to speak to the Manager about what I just witnessed in regards to the bartender failing to ring my transaction, return my change and provide me with a receipt.  I go into the restaurant and find the Manager named Scott.  I relate to him exactly what I have outlined here, and I describe in exact detail what the bartender did.  This Manager Scott, and I utilize that term loosely in this context, because Scott certainly did not behave like a Manager.  After I explain what I witnessed, he looks at me with this blank stare and says, ''I will go and get you your change right now''.  I explain to him, ''It's not about my .11 cents, It's about the principal of the matter.  Are you at all concerned that your bartender is taking cash that belongs in your cash register drawer and putting it in her tip bucket and failing to properly ring transactions?''  Scott immediately becomes defensive and very rude and states, ''Maybe she thought it was a tip.  Look, I don't understand what you are complaining about.  I offered to get your change and you refused.  I will have a conversation with her and that conversation is none of your business''.  I reply ''May I ask you a question, how come I did not receive a receipt for my beer purchase?''  Scott replies, ''It's our policy to only issue a receipt when requested to do so''.  \nI reply....''WRONG!  I received a receipt 1 hour before from the same bartender for my lunch purchase, AND I DID NOT REQUEST IT!  So what is your receipt policy Scott?''  By this time Scott is becoming visibly agitated with me and again, in a very rude and condescending manner, ''Look I told you I would speak with her about it and you already said you don't want your change so what else is there to talk about.  At that point, I state, ''you know what, I'm done speaking with you, have a nice day\".  So I proceed to finish my beer and prepare to leave.  I glance down at the end of the bar and I notice manager Scott speaking to a well-dressed gentleman who just entered the restaurant, and I see Scott motion over to me, as if he is relating my story to this other gentleman.  \n\nNext thing I know, this man comes up to me and Scott introduces him as Mr. Ross B, Vice president & Managing partner of the restaurant.  I'm naming this gentleman, because he requested that I do so when I told him he could read my review on YELP.    Mr. B. goes on to state that Scott told him about my experience.  A this point I inform Mr. B that Scott is very rude and spoke to me in a very condescending and unwelcomed tone of voice.  I went on to say that I was more than happy to speak with him, but I was done conversing with Scott and he could exit our conversation.  Scott leaves and goes back to work.  Mr. B. goes on to state that he had never known Scott to be rude.  I told him that he would probably be amazed at some of the behavior of his employees when he was not present at his restaurant.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT LIKE THE PLAGUE!", "stars": 1}
{"text": "I just had the worst experience here. It started with a cluster of a mess waiting for a table since there was no hostess or waitlist. We saw another aggravated couple seat themselves at the bar so we did the same. We ordered egg rolls, chicken pho, and rice combo. Simple enough right? No lobster this, no oxtail that. \n\nAm I suppose to ask for my side garnishes when ordering pho? Accept my apology if it's suppose to be ordered a la carte. My pho came out first and sat there as I tried to flag down any staff member. Fifteen minutes later, my boyfriend's rice combo comes out so we asked the food runner for the garnishes for my pho and fish sauce for his rice. By the time that came out, she brought along the eggrolls. I'm not even upset about the sequence of the food but damn, 2 of 4 of my eggrolls were soggy because it was placed under all the wet greens. I asked for our check since we seem to be adding on to the masses that were stressing out the staff. I am in the restaurant industry so I totally understand, but for such a beautiful business opportunity... staff up, get more organized, and be consistent. Smile even if you're stressed from all the big tops, I lived in Vegas prior and learned to treat the tourists kindly.

{"text": "Barbara provided book keeping and tax preparation service for my business.\nBarbara is a bit of an odd duck. I am not sure that I have heard someone use more words to say so very little on such a regular basis. I think it is in part of a sub conscience strategy to deflect your attention away from her frequent uncertainty about how to answer what I would consider typical questions. I tolerated her since she was the devil I knew and figured I would be okay in the end. \n\nTurns out there were three issues that came up that are a direction result of acts or omission on her part. Accordingly, I would avoid the use of her service unless you are feeling lucky.\n1. We discussed and she confirmed that since my business is taxed as an SCorp and the taxes would be filed by me as an individual and I had no quarterly tax liability. She asserted that she told me that I did have a quarterly tax liability. If that was the case I would asked her to calculate my quarterly tax liability for the year in October 2015 when we first started doing business. I found out about my liability from the IRS via a letter indicating I owed penalties on unpaid quarterly taxes from 2015. I was quite surprised by this letter. I emailed Barbara to ask about the letter and she said:\n\"Issam,\nI am sorry if you misunderstood the quarterly payments and associated penalties. Looking back at my records, I see that you did not start using my services until the last quarter of 2015. You had already missed your estimates for 2015. I do not calculate penalties and interest. That is up to the IRS. \nI know that we discussed your quarterly payment obligations. It is up to you to make those payments. \nBarbara\"\nI understand that paying my taxes with my money is my obligation. Had we ever had any conversation about my missed quarterly tax liability I would have asked her to calculate them for my Year-to-Date. I even asked her for a tax estimate and the estimate made no mention of quarterly tax liabilities. Who files taxes for a client and doesn't calculate quarterly penalties? Even the H&R Block people can calculate penalties and interest.  Even worse, who files taxes for a client and say absolutely nothing about penalties and interest during the tax preparation process. Barbara Joyce did that. Why I would I go to the trouble hiring a book keeper to help me get QBO in order and to file my taxes and then completely ignore the need to calculate quarterly taxes? Her assertion in her email is not in keeping with the facts as they exist and makes no sense.  \n2. I received my Arizona return. I had been expecting about $2800 refund and instead they found an error and now I owe them $2700. That is about a $5500 error. I didn't even bother raising this issue with her given the way she responded when I told her that I no longer require her services.\nI said this after her previous email, \"Very well then. That is too large of a misunderstanding for my liking. Thank you for your services. I'll be moving to find another accountant.\"\nBarbara's response to losing a client was,\" That works for me.\"\n\n\n3. She is very unprofessional. I had her to my home on 2 occasions to discuss my finances and she brought along with her \"baggage\" about other clients. She spent at least 30 minutes on each occasion telling me about how terrible some of her clients are and what she thinks of how they do business. Very unprofessional and I am sure once this review is seen I will end up in her rotation of bad mouthing clients.\n\nConsider yourselves warned she isn't very good at her job and her demeanor moves directly to a defensive posture when you question her about what she says and what she does. At the end of the day if you are a small business you need a competent partner that you can trust. Barbara turned out to be neither competent nor trust worthy.", "stars": 1}

{"text": "I recently (regrettably) visited this Frite Alors,  My partner and I thought it would be a good choice since the menu had a few vegetarian options and I'm vegetarian.  I ordered the Croque Vegetarian with fries; it seemed like a good choice - until the sandwich came and there was a chunk of ground beef in it.  Fine for meat-eaters; not fine for vegetarians.  \n\nWe alerted our waitress to this fact; she told us it must have have been an accident, but offered no apology, no concern, or no new sandwich.  Further, she told us that the fries aren't even vegetarian because they're cooked in beef fat.  \n\nWe then told her it would be a good idea to tell customers who order a vegetarian meal that the fries are not in fact vegetarian, since it's not mentioned anywhere on the menu.  She told us that she eats meat, but sometimes orders the vegetarian sandwich because she 'likes avocados', so there's no need to tell customers about the fries.  Additionally, she told us the restaurant specializes in Belgian style fries, suggesting everyone must already know the fries are cooked in beef fat.  Perhaps they know in Belgium - but we're in Quebec.  It's not uncommon to assume that fries are cooked in vegetable oil.\n\nSome things this restaurant should note: \n\nIf you have vegetarian items on your menu, your servers probably should NOT assume the customer ordered it because he 'eats meat but likes vegetables'.  \n\nIf you have vegetarian items on your menu, your servers probably SHOULD assume vegetarians will order it. \n\nIf you have vegetarian options on your menu, you should consider indicating that the fries are not in fact vegetarian.  \n\nNot all vegetarians are vegetarian by choice.", "stars": 1}

{"text": "I have went to this spa 3 times in a span of 3 years. The facials itself were positive experiences as all estheticians have been pleasant and hard-working. However last Friday was my first interaction with the owner of this business. It was not surprising that she pushed hard to sell her products. I did have the feeling that the owner was speaking \"down\" to me when telling me about the products. But I just dismissed that since she doesn't know anything about me or my background. Prior to treatment it is customary to remove necklace that may become oily or soiled during the treatment. My issue is after the treatment my esthetician and I both forgot to get my Tiffany Elsa Peretti bean necklace back as I was in a rush to get to another appointment. I called this morning to let the spa know, with certainty, that I had left it there at the spa. In persons with good faith, they hold my item for me until I can get it or if not immediately visible are cooperative and allow me to look for it and are sympathetic that it may be missing. I had a very negative experience with the owner Aminah Mujadidi-Brewer. She told me plainly and in a cold manner \"I am the owner and it isn't in our lost and found.\" I then asked to speak with the esthetician who performed the facial and Aminah told me she wasn't available. I told her I would like to stop by and look for it myself. She continued with \"I am the owner and it isn't here.\" I pressed and I told her that there is no doubt in my mind that the necklace was left there and if it wasn't it was stolen. Aminah then hung up the phone. (I think is very childish.)  When I went there all the outside doors were locked when the business is clearly advertised as open today during this time.  Her conceited nature leaves me to think that she thinks it is acceptable to treat patrons with disrespect. Her lack of cooperation and help leaves me suspicious there is some foul play with the owner and my necklace.  Even though the facial itself was a positive experience I will not provide my business to owners that does not have client's best interests at heart especially for the prices that are charged, I would expect the feeling that I am \"being taken care of.\" Reality is quite the contrary at this spa with the owner. This I am highly suspicious of her involvement with my missing Elsa Peretti Tiffany necklace.", "stars": 1}

After the excruciating process of finding a parking space we stepped from our Prius into the excruciating, and miserable, heat. Unloading our modest amount or luggage we unknowingly began our journey to the TI lobby. We rush into the air conditioned block of elevators adjacent to the parking garage and hit the glowing brick that says 'casino/hotel'. The ding announces our arrival. We exit and look down an unfamiliar and unmarked hallway. I turn to my partner, \"is this the way?\" His response, \"I believe it is the only way.\" We take a step towards our inevitable doom towards the clatter and commotion of the intoxicated arcade. We come across a set of escalators downward to the gates of hell it seems, but no the sign disagrees stating, 'hotel/casino' once again. I turn and hesitate, we continue on. Once at the base we are surrounded by merchandise and flyer flickers pleading for our attention, \"NO!\" We manage to mumble, \"we just want to set down our things and take refuge before facing death.\" They refuse our pleas. We walk for minutes that seem like hours, \"which way?!\" Do we really have to walk through this mini-mall to get to out hotel lobby?! It was right there?! Or so we thought.

{"text": "This is my first review, so bare with me.  This place is very good (4.5 overall).  The service was pretty good (3.5 loses some on missing food and insanely hot inside at first, but cooled down eventually), although we were the only people in the place, it was about 5pm on a Friday afternoon.  I had read all the other 10 or so reviews here on this place and thought it was worth a try.  So why should you keep reading?  I'm Asian, yeah, seriously.  My mom is a crazy good cook, all flavors - every Chinese style, Vietnamese, Thai, and Cambodian.  My family is 1st generation immigrants so I've eaten pretty authentic dishes.  The owner shares the same background as my family except she's Cambodian and my family is Chinese living in Cambodia.  We chatted for a bit with the female owner and exchanged a couple stories.  I also let her witness my terrible Cambodian, which my family also gets a kick out of, our main dialect is Cantonese.  Let's get into the food....\nJasmine iced tea, very good.  I typically like mine stronger, but not a real complaint.  We had the spring rolls first, the non fried version.  Very good and the fish sauce is also delicious.  Personally I like pork belly in mine, but chicken and shrimp is good also.  For the main course; I had katheaw soup - steak, tripe, and meatballs.  This is the only place I know of in the valley that has japquie (sp), fried bread sticks, or what they call in Cali and Seattle - Chinese donut sticks.  This to me is the real way to eat noodle soup!  What is maybe a little lacking is the fresh herbs and bean sprouts, oh and get me some tendon in the soup.  I actually didn't get the fried bread as part of my soup meal, but I did order a side so my wife could try, so not a big deal.  My wife had the katheaw cha, stir fried rice noodles and beef, and we also tried the pate & pork meatball sandwich.  The stir fry noodles were good, a lot of garlic, so be ready for that, but I don't mind.  The sandwich was excellent and this will now become our regular spot for these type of sandwiches.  We also had dessert; banana tapioca pudding.  Sorry Mom, Sekong's is better=).  There wasn't Bahn Cha (sp?) on the menu when we went, I would like to try theirs sometime though.  There are a few things on a Cambodian menu I would want to see also, but overall I'm pretty impressed.  The son was our waiter and we shared what we considered our favorite dishes that weren't on the menu, he likes the same desserts as my brother and oddly enough they look a lot a like!\nPrice is good and the food is very believable, we will be back again soon and will bring friends to this hidden gem.", "stars": 4}

However, during my last trip last week someone smashed the back window of my SUV and stole work equipment out of the back.   It happened sometime during the early morning hours and when I told the front desk clerk she was marginally interested.  She told me someone reported it at 6am and \"they were waiting for me to come down .. .\"  What?  You can't call me?  That's an emergency by any definition.  She took about 5 minutes taking a reservation over the phone while I simmered in the lobby.  She then merely handed me a piece of paper with Metro's 311 number.  Great.  I could've figured that out myself.  I do business with Metro so I was able to speak directly with an officer I know about what happened and his last question was \"why are you staying there?\"  I told him I liked the hotel and then he told me that Metro is constantly called to that area for burglaries, robberies, and other crimes due to the meth epidemic in the area.   He told me I was lucky I wasn't harmed.  Later that day I asked for the manager and asked about any security cameras they might have to provide any information on the case.  He told me he didn't have access to that information but to come back the next morning and the GM would help me.  So I came back the next day and I was directed to the front desk manager (note: not the GM).  He informed me that no security cameras exist.  When I asked why not he said that \"that would be a violation of our guests' privacy.\"  I smelled B.S. right away but didn't pursue it.  I am a HH Gold member and called the HH desk the next day and reported the crime.  They told me the GM would call me within 72 hours.   Never happened.  They did throw me a bunch of points but the whole thing was handled rather nonchalantly.  During my last 2 nights there I made sure I didn't leave as much as a cardboard box in my car.   I also was more alerted and noticed a steady stream of vagrants cutting through the parking lot from Swenson to Paradise, including one junky that gave me the typical sob story about how he needed gas to get to Utah but his card was declined.  I shooed him away   I wouldn't recommended anyone stay at this hotel until they install cameras, 24/7 roving security, and gate key access to the parking lot.

The interior trim panels that had been removed were not put back in place, there was a gap of approx. one quarter inch between the windshield and the seal that let both wind and water in, the dome lights were no longer working and there were nicks on the trunk that were not there when car was delivered to Progressive.

A couple days later I noted the decals on the rear of deck lid  were CLK 240 instead of C240. That fix has still not been accomplished. I have advised Progressive to get someone else to fix it as there is obviously no quality control or pride in work done by Road Runner. I have been thru Progressive Collision and always had top notch service and never a problem with repair.

The restaurant was very hot so I don't think a/c was working or it was not turned on.  The workers were sweating.  One kept opening the large refrigerator to fan herself.  The time to receive my meal took way too long.  Looked like they may have been short staffed.  What really blew my mind though was the fact that when I finished my meal I needed to use the restroom & to wash my hands from having a messy sandwich.  I was told that this location does not offer restrooms & that I would have to walk over to KFC to use their restroom.  I said What?!!!!  I am a paying customer & just ate in your restaurant & you cannot offer a restroom?  The worker said no & that's the way it is.  I asked for the manager & was told the same thing.  They do not have restrooms for customers.  I have never heard of such a thing!  I watched as another customer had to walk over to KFC to use their restroom after placing their order.  I was appalled!  There is absolutely no excuse not to offer restroom facilities to paying customers at the very least to wash hands since you are eating a meal there!  I could understand a little if restroom was out of order for a particular reason, but that was not the case.  Needless to say, I will not be back to this location as they obviously do not value their customers.  Bit of advice, if you do visit here, make sure you go to restroom somewhere else beforehand & bring some sanitary hand wipes with you as you will not be able to wash your hands unless you walk over to the KFC which a customer should not have to do.", "stars": 1}

They very rarely have the express lane open anymore and only operate with 2 maybe 3 cashiers tops which creates long lines most of the time.

There is usually little to no interaction and much of the time they have really bad attitudes especially the manager on duty when you can find one.  Don't even get me started on the service deli.

{"text": "Spent a few days here in July with our kids (under 10). We chose this place for a couple reasons:\n\n1. Away from the strip\n2. Resort like feel\n3. Very Family Friendly\n4. Close to good name brand restaurants (it's not in the middle of nowhere)\n5. Not too far from the strip\n6. Have status with Marriot, and have had solid experience with JW's around the globe\n\nRooms: The double queen room was nice (in spa tower), not as modern as say the MGM Signature, but clean and tasteful. The views were great from the balcony (we could see the golf course, pool, grounds and stream). \n\nService: Very friendly staff, check in and out were a breeze, Complimentary valet was great and vehicle was consistently delivered in under 2 minutes\n\nDining: We got the breakfast package (without the package a buffet for 4 runs ~ $60). Breakfast was good (smoked salmon, sausage, bacon, omelet station, waffles, pancakes, hash brown, cereal, fruits etc etc).  Totally worth getting the breakfast package. Did not have lunch or dinner from here.\n\nPublic Facilities: Pool was awesome, maximum depth of 4 feet was perfect for kids, the waterfall was a huge hit for sure. Grounds are very well kept, there's a volley ball court, golf course, running area for kids, streams etc. Overall a very nice place. No loud mouthed party animals here, mostly middle aged couples with kids (which was perfect for us) and retirees in the casinos.\n\nThere is an optional $25 resort fee, which is a pretty good deal if you do not have status with Marriott (depending on status, Internet, fitness center and spa are free). It includes spa and fitness center, Internet access, 2 bottles of water, golf balls, free appetizers and I forget what else.\n\nOverall, we will stay here when we come to Vegas.

{"text": "I want to preface my review with the fact that my Mediterranean knowledge is based on a handful of places in the valley; some better than others, (in my opinion).  At the risk of the yelp*ing community throwing themselves off Camelback mountain, I have to say that Pita jungle sort of sets the bar for me when it comes to overall taste, portion size, and quality.  Having said that, I was fortunate to try Hummus Xpress (hard to take the place serious with the name) this afternoon.  Based on the reviews alone, I was expecting a lot and was not disappointed. Live music, handful of tables, not much of a line and fairly straightforward system of ordering.  If you read more than two other reviews, I don't have to repeat the process.  It was nice to get some guidance from the line, though I was a little confused by the pricing aspect: .60 cents per item on veggies.  I wasn't clear if that was across the menu or just that region but I was so aware of it that it kept me from really wanting to pile on anymore than a single veggie.  Portion size was adequate, the bowl can hold a lot of food and you fill the bowl easily with delicious ingredients.  I sampled a few flavors of hummus and too be honest, I prefer my hummus warm which this was not but was still tasty.  What seems like a limited menu actually is fairly vast and it would be possible to have the same thing twice only by accident.  Pitas were soft and warm and the iced tea was special.  Push-button iced tea is an abomination so it was nice to see handwritten exotic flavors that didn't make you roll your eyes.  Hummus Xpress (*sigh) is now in the rotation and on the board for a good quality lunch.", "stars": 4}

So, naturally, I have been frequenting Gadzooks for a little over a month now and am more than happy to submit an almost perfect review of their establishment.\nPros:\nFood is amazing.  With a very from scratch taste and feel I appreciate, along with new items that hit the chalk board and run the risk of availability, it's hard to go in and get the same old same old every time.  This is the one thing places like Chipotle can't exactly replicate and I admire; new flavors and dishes are what make this stand apart.\nEnchiladas are made to order with enough customization choices to keep you going back.   Pulled Buffalo enchiladas? I managed the last one and considered putting it up on EBAY.  The enchilada oven.  There is something special about watching your dish enter the oven and the cheese bubbles with happiness.  \nCons:  \nGet there early.  Parking is at a premium though not as bad as most places on 7th st.  Here is my issue; the line.  The whole process operates like subway, chipotle, etc which isn't too bad but for the fact that your dish can come out of the oven and sit for minutes until you are able to pay, fight the single drink dispenser, and get seated.  I have on more than one occasion diverted to another restaurant if I spot a line out the door.  \nTrue, good things come to those who wait but I dislike lines for food so that is my only hangup with Gadzooks, who otherwise has some of the tastiest enchiladas made to order I have had the pleasure of sampling for some time.", "stars": 4}

When I got home and took a bite of the burrito I got a shrimp in my first bite only to find that the shell and tail were still on the shrimp. I opened the burrito to see if it was the only one like that and maybe it was just overlooked but they were all like that. I called the restaurant and spoke with Francisco, I asked him do they normally leave the shell and tail on the shrimp in the shrimp burritos and he said \"uh I don't know that's how the cook made it.\" And after a few seconds when he realized I didn't like that answer he said \"yes we do\". I said that was the dumbest thing I've ever heard because in doing that I have to open the burrito and remove the shells and tails and then reassemble the burrito which never seems to be as good as the first time. I asked to speak to the manager and he said the manager wasn't in and after I asked him the manager's name and he told me it was Victor he hung up like we were done with the conversation.

{"text": "I have been a Verizon customer for years and every time I walk into the Boca Park location I walk out mad! This time around I was helped by Eric. What I was attempting to do was turn in my phone one month early and he basically said that I could not accomplish what I wanted to do at the store, and would have to have it mailed to me. \"The date on the expiration contract is the date for a reason and I cannot do anything about it!\" No amount of my letting him know that my account should already indicate that I had permission to do so was going to sway him.  He was rude, and disrespectful and as this is not the first time at this location that I was frustrated.  While I was on the phone with corporate I walked out and went straight to the S Rainbow location - the difference in how I was greeted was night in day.  Instead of hearing \"that cannot be done\" I heard \" I understand the problem and let me see what I can do!\"  I do not think Verizon's corporate mantra is to frustrate their customers to the point where they are considering switching providers and frankly I do not intend to ever solicit the Boca Park location again.  The Eric was not a  Solutions Provider - he is a Solutions Obstructionist. George however at the S Rainbow location was awesome, helpful, respectful, and professional - and amazingly found a way to help me.  I must also say that I observed the other staff and they also were great, including the Manager (whose name I cannot remember - but she was most helpful).

I had the Sopes,  (Sopes -Three  handmade tortillas gorditas, lightly deep fried. Topped with chorizo, carne asada or pollo asado.) with carne asada a taco, basically, but with a  thicker, fried corn tortilla, complete with onions, cilantro, etc.  No sissy lettuce and tomato on these tacos.  It also came with beans and rice (some of the better rice I've had, I find it always to be dry and bland, but I like flavor) I finished 2 of them (out of the 3 I had), but couldn't handle eating anymore.  My boyfriend had a dish that was even better than mine.  I can't remember the name of it, but I'm waiting for him to answer me so I know what it is. - Now I know! It was the Steak Picado- (New York steak in small chunks, saut\u00e9ed with onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, tomatoes and mixed with Spanish & verde sauce.) I remember, it was nice chunks of meat in a red sauce (not mole, not chile colorado), I took a bite of it, and the meat was incredibly tender, not the dry, in the crockpot for 6 hours, shredded tender, the tender that only comes from a good piece of meat.  It yields slightly, but as soon as you bit in, it's pure, soft, moist bliss.  And no gristle!  Their handmade tortillas are also very, very good.  I watched the nice lady make tortillas the whole time I was there, she was a busy lady!  \nWe finished it off with the fried ice cream.  To me, it left more to be desired.  The coating seemed...almost stale, it was hard to chew and the ice cream was just plain vanilla ice cream.  I heard the table next to us order the fried banana after the waiter's suggestion, they seemed satisfied with it and finished the whole thing.

{"text": "Two servers.  TWO servers for an entire dining room that's full.  Don't assume you're going to get anything in a decent time frame.  We watched a couple next to us sit down, with the tip money from the previous folks on the table.  After a few minutes, they got up and left.  They hadn't even been offered drinks and the tip money was still there. We watched the next couple come in and after about 10, the husband looked as if he was going to fall asleep at their table. Okay, on to the food:  I ordered the Mandarin ginger chicken salad and when it came, it was in a HUGE bowl.  However, when I moved the leaves over with my fork, to my surprise I hit the plate with ease.  The salad was literally about one inch deep, it wasn't even as deep as the tines on the fork!  Keep in mind this was an entree salad and not a side salad.  I like how they do an eye trick, in giving you a giant bowl with a very wide brim, it makes you think you are getting more.  I ate my salad in about 5 minutes and was very disappointed.  The flavor was good, don't get me wrong.  You can't really screw up greens, 4 slices of chicken, some canned mandarin oranges, pre-sliced cucumbers and a dressing that is a basic, sweet soy dressing. But for $11 even the Cheesecake factory gives me a larger bowl of salad.  The Irish onion soup is a waste.  Croutons are not whole pieces of bread that are soggy.  You use croutons for a reason, so that it can soak up some of the liquid and stay decently together.  It was also super salty (but I will admit, I live in a low-salt household, so I'm used to not using salt).  The boyfriend (he posted a review below) had the Dublin burger and I just didn't think it worked on the firm ciabatta bread.  It had two little squirts of ranch and bbq sauce, which barely made a streak of color on the bun.  He ordered it medium and it was closer to medium rare and VERY pink.  He managed to eat just under half of it and I knew at that moment, that it was bad.  See, my boyfriend can pack away some pretty crappy food and he NEVER leaves that much burger on his plate.   The wings were decent but for 8 wings for $10.95 it's not worth it.    If you're going there for late night wings/greasy food and some drinks, go on ahead, but please don't go and expect a good meal.  However, their stuffed baked potatoes looked good and I was kicking myself for not ordering one.  Perhaps they are better... Oh, the fries were good!", "stars": 1}

The Curry Noodles, are also pretty good too.  The Red Curry itself is good, as is the Panang.  We ordered Thai Fried Rice last time, and it was mighty good.  Just a simple fried rice (almost like chinese) with pork.  The best item on the menu though, the dish that makes my boyfriend erect with delight, is the Beef salad, Nom Tok, NOT the regular spicy beef salad, but specifically the Nom Tok.  It's just beef, cilandro, red onions and sometimes they throw some lettuce on the side, which we diligently toss to the side of the container.  The sauce is tasty, limey, spicy, and I love the ground rice powder, gives it a nice texture.  I also like their Pad Prik King too (just spicy sauce, like a chili sauce/almost chili oil) with Beef.

Get the veggies and pineapple rings for $3 a person - it really adds to the meal! We had the $9.95 each all-you-can-eat and left stuffed. The service was fine: friendly; prompt; helpful and cheerful. Tell them if you've never been before. They'll explain things and it helps. We'll be back with friends from out of town to show them a fun, late-night nosh!

{"text": "EVERYONE BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOUR PHONE OR WALLET WILL GET STOLEN AT THIS HORRIBLE CLUB!! THIS HAPPENS EVERY WEEKEND AT THIS CLUB TO DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE ACCORDING TO CAESARS HOTEL LOST AND FOUND AND OTHER YELP REVIEWERS!!!!! Unfortunately I did not read yelp reviews prior to being forced to go to this shitty club. Last saturday night my phone got stolen directly from my purse that was on me while I was dancing in the heart club, most probably during the gimicky VERY BLINDING and freezing blast of smoke streams that they periodically have every 15 minutes. I immediately told the security guard and in an extremely rude tone said he could not help me even though he was just standing there staring into space the whole time. I was absolutely devastated as this was my first time in Vegas and I had taken hundreds and hundreds of photos from grand canyon and Vegas with my fiance on this phone that I will never get back. I am an ER nurse who very badly needed a vacation from this very stressful job. Those photos are memories with my fiance that I will never get back. I created this yelp account just to write this review so that I can warn everyone because I have never felt so strongly before to bother writing a review for any other place except this one to save people in the future from going through such devastation and loss.\n\nI went to the lost and found in Caesars hotel where Omnia sends their lost items and verbatim he told me a dozen people had already showed up before me and had their phones stolen the night before. He said this has happened every weekend at Omnia for many years and Omnia has never once done anything about it or improving their security. I find this extremely baffling because I had to go through about 10 people on the million lines at Omnia that you have to stand on prior to actually making it into the club and NOT ONE PERSON WARNED ME OF THIS VERY COMMON OCCURRENCE AT THIS CLUB. If they at least had the courtesy or a decent heart to warn me of this I would've been mindful of having a strong grasp on my purse at all times. Thus I believe Omnia hires these people to steal phones so they can be sold at ridiculous prices and they pay them off while making a ridiculous profit!!!\n\nAnd everyone please remember, these people turn off your phones immediately which prevents it from being tracked by a phone tracker such as Find My IPhone so don't assume oh if this happens to me I will just use that because it will not work!! \n\nThis happens to not only females. They also steal wallets and phones right from men's pants!!! So everyone please spread the word and don't give this shitty establishment anymore of your money. I have now made it my target to return to this club many times when I can get in for free as I do not live too far and to scope out these grimey thieves and record them in action while I pretend to dance and have fun. I will have all of them arrested. And I will be telling everyone I know to only go to this club when they can get in for free which is not hard to do and to do the same. I hope they all go to hell as well as the owners of this club!!", "stars": 1}

Afterward we felt limber and relaxed; just like we should after a good massage. I like a deep massage and they delivered on that note!

My masseuse ran out of oil and had to stop momentarily to go get more. No biggie, but it broke the flow. Also, another worker called my wife's masseuse out of the room. Again it only took a second, but broke the flow. We were staying at the MGMgrand so it was a 25 minute taxi ride and cost about $35 (each way) keep that in mind when totaling up the costs.

She asked the questions from her laptop and clicked away on the keyboard, fine, whatever, than comes to weight and height chart for my 13-month old.  Dr. Shi asks how many bottles is she eating? What does she eat? Blah blah blah.  She proceeds to tell me \"Your baby is obese.\"  Really? A baby is obese?  Granted my baby is a chunk of love, but she's happy, healthy, growing and thriving, no need for labeling my chunk of love as obese.  I thought it was COMPLETELY uncalled for to say \"Your baby is obese.\"  Her bedside manners are um what's the word?? HORRIBLE.  Maybe she should practice being kind when working with babies, children and adolescents.  Perhaps saying, \"Oh, I can see she likes to eat, let's try cutting back on a bottle or two.\"  or maybe \"We might want to watch her weight at the next appointment.\"  Instead she said my baby is obese.

I was told the person who had my items would return them and the shop would deliver it to my home. That's awesome I thought. Well 6 weeks later, multiple phone calls and stopping in the shop I still don't have my items back.The owner Tracie  left me several nasty voicemails, yelling at my phone.  After 6 weeks of trying to get my stuff back, Tracie told me she donated my collar, tags and leash but would not tell me where. She donated my stolen property and was rude. There is a dog out there with my dogs tags and information !!!  (That's if she really did donate them and does not have a side business selling stolen property).

We had a friendly waiter that tried really hard to learn everyone names. As for the food. The cheese fondue was delicious it came with bread, nachos, apples, and vegetables to dip with. The salad, main course and chocolate fondue that came following were okay. It's wasn't exceptional good. It's not worth what you pay for. Not including tips it was $50/person including tax. Although it was a 4 course meal what they give you isn't worth what you are paying for. For example for the cheese fondue it's just a small cup of vegetables, apples, and nachos with a ton of bread to soak up all the cheese. Although this course was good I wouldn't say it's worth it. \n\nThe second time i came with 8 other people. They charged a mandatory 18% gratuity  on our bill which i thought was ridiculous. I understand they charge 15% for larger parties...but 18% is a bit much. So with tax its a extra 31% charge on your meal. And because there was a  mandatory gratuity the waiter really didn't care about his service. He gave us attitude. I had to ask him for water 3 times before he remembered to refill our cups with water. I asked for a refill since the cheese fondue, then finally at the end of my 3rd course (the main course) he finally brought out a jug of water. Since there were 9 of us we were at two different tables. The other table didn't get their main course till literately 30-40minutes after we got ours. It took our waiter another 30 minute to give us our bill. So we just put down the exact change so we could leave right away. We were there from 6pm till just past 10pm. So it was a LONG LONG dinner. \n\nSince we know that the 4 course meal was expensive amongst the 4 at one table we shared ONE cheese fondue order and we each ordered a main course that came with the salad. Yet the bill came out to be $44 including tips and tax. Which I thought was ridiculously expensive. \n\nBe prepared for it  to be minimum 3 hour meal. Its a huge waste of time and money.

Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.\n\nIts always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly.

{"text": "The worst servicing of an order I have ever experienced anywhere. Went one week ahead of time to order some desserts for a dinner party, because I was told a 'special order' requires one week's notice. I arrived the morning of the pick-up day--all smiles, along with my wife--to just CHECK on the order...simply to make sure our time-frame would be honored later that day (was on a tight schedule). I even offered to pay for it to save time on the back-end, even though it's pick-up time wasn't for 6 or 6 1/2 hours later. They eventually found the order still sitting on their order board, and said there would be no problem--really? Why one week's notice when the order is just sitting there completely forgotten? They couldn't even find it at first. They also could NOT ring up the order ahead of time (why, I am not sure).  Returned at the appointed pick-up time...NO order! Was told they were just wrapping it up...(and this was NOT a big or complicated order, especially with a week's advance notice!). My wife and I sat for a few moments, and I went to the washroom. Through a window that looked into the kitchen from the hallway, I saw one lady feverishly trying to dress petit-fours. It was clearly my order. The order hadn't even BEGUN to be filled! I was getting very irritated, so my wife suggested that I go to our hotel and check-out while she waited. I did so and returned...still no order. In short, the order was one hour late by the time we paid for it. I wanted to just walk out, and told them so; but my wife just HAD to have these desserts for a dinner party. So we paid...no discount...even though MY time is definitely worth some money too! My wife said aloud: \"C'mon honey, they are a small business...give them a break\".  To the ladies who own/operate this shop: I am a small business, and I am immensely successful precisely because I am fully reliable. NEVER late. My associates are not uninformed, as are your front of house staff; and as an owner/proprietor, I care about my customers...unlike you. Your attitudes were truculent, condescending, and arrogant...but your pastries were indeed pretty good (but that is the only compliment you are getting). No matter how good the desserts, this order was not worth my time or your attitudes. Here is a reality check...you are running a business...straighten out your personalities, be on time, and hire extra artisans if that is what it takes. But don't EVER keep customers waiting an additional hour for an order that was placed one week in advance. To your relief I am sure, you can be certain that I will not be returning to spend my money in your establishment. To others who are reading this...be forewarned.", "stars": 1}

Standard protocol for performing such a procedure at the very MINIMUM requires that the provider explains the procedure so you aren't completely surprised when they jam an over sized q-tip up your nose.

Simple accommodation considering that the regular michelada (with tomato juice) is on the menu. The waiter acted as if I wanted something extra special, and told me that he could not accommodate me??? What?! I guess he forgot how much he was charging for a plate of his restaurant's award winning food... He forgot how much we waited for a table, he even forgot to check and see if he actually could attempt to accommodate my needs. He said \"I will get you the regular michelada, and you don't have to pay for it if you don't like it\" which he promptly forgot about.

Although I would have preferred that type of experience, we had a quiet and lovely afternoon lunch. Out of the eight meals we tried, the BBQ pork buns and siu mai dumplings were the best.

{"text": "Pampas was putrid. My girlfriend and I went because of restaurant.com, and I realize that a restaurant.com offer should be a red flag to begin with, but I work across the street from Planet Hollywood and my girlfriend is a Brazilian steakhouse aficionado. So we went.\n\nIt was a huge mistake. The service was great. Our server Marco was friendly and attentive, burdened by poor management and a sub par kitchen. But even his excellent service couldn't make up for all the problems with our meal. It started off poorly; we sat down and ordered Hendricks martinis and a bottle of Pinot - yes we are drinkers - and they were out of both. We nixed the cocktails and picked another bottle, and to Pampas' credit they adjusted the price to match the 86'ed bottle. We were optimistic, glad they went out of their way to accommodate us.\n\nThere are essentially 3 options on the menu: meat, seafood, and both. I believe the meat was 43, the seafood 48, and the combo 54. I got the seafood and my girl got the meat. Yes it's ok that sentence was funny. \n\nI am a Brazilian steakhouse neophyte, so I was a little surprised that the first thing we do after ordering was go to a salad bar. This was disgusting. Wilted salad, stale bread, and a stab at Asian cuisine that makes PF Chiang's look like Nobu. I grabbed a little Caesar salad and cafeteria pasta salad and braced for the worst.\n\nAnd worse it got. First of all, as soon as we sat down from the salad bar they immediately started piling my girlfriend's plate with food, but my seafood took 25 minutes, so that was slightly awkward. However, it did give me a chance to sample the meat. \n\nThe meat sucked. We had pork tenderloin first, which was woefully overcooked. This was followed by beef that had some kind of cheese crust that was disgusting. The procession that followed was all mediocre at best, and it was all overcooked! We went in late, like 930, so maybe that was why everything was dry and well done. But for the price I don't think it's too much to\nask for properly cooked meat. The lone exception was the lamb, which was delicious.\n\nEventually my seafood came. It came with baked salmon, cod, shrimp, and mussels. The menu claimed bacon-wrapped scallops were included as well, but we didn't receive those until we requested them. It was essentially buffet quality seafood. The mussels were cold. Only half the shrimp were actually peeled. The fried cod was hard and hot on the outside and cold on the inside. When the scallops finally showed up, they were also cold.\n\nWe skipped dessert. The whole experience was dismal, and the modicum of savings we got from restaurant.com didn't really make up for the waste of 2 hours. Planet Hollywood is simply a black\nhole for food, I would avoid the whole hotel.", "stars": 1}

{"text": "I saw my friend's show here and, not being familiar with downtown, I went to their website to find out what the parking options are. They recommend parking at the Arizona Center garage, with a $6 pass they can sell you at the theater box office. This seemed like a good deal, so I did it. \n\nThe Arizona Center is more than half a mile from the theater, which did not bother me until I ran into a problem.  My problem was that I could not exit the garage with the parking pass. I tried more than one lane, in case there was a malfunctioning machine. Still no dice. I had been sold a bad parking pass. So I called the theater for help I spoke to someone who did not apologize to me and also tried to blame me, saying the pass is only good after 5pm. Unless they need to update their website, this is absolutely untrue, because it was a Saturday and the pass is supposed to be good all day on weekends according to the site. He then asked me if my credit card wasn't working in the machine, which is completely missing the point, since I had ALREADY PAID for parking, or at least thought I had.  He had no solution for me and I did end up paying an additional $18 to leave the garage.  The man promised me a phone call from the box office manager that night. \n\nI called several times in the next few days, with little success at speaking with and actual human, and reached one girl who told me I should come down and talk to the manager in person.  I can't believe that I had to point out to her that going there in person, aside from being a huge inconvenience I should not have to suffer, means that I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO PARK. \n\nFOUR DAYS and many voicemails from me later, i finally received a call from the box office manager. He asked me to scan the $18 parking receipt and email it to him, and he would get me the refund from the Arizona Center back onto the card I used to pay for it, since the machine knows what card it was. So I did.  Then I received an email from him with an attached form to fill out in order to process the refund. This form asks for all of my personal information, all of my credit card information, and my signature. It's like they have no idea that it is 2017 and identity theft is a huge problem!  I emailed him back and said that I am in no way comfortable sending all my personal details into the great unsecured beyond and perhaps there is another way to resolve this. The box office manager had also mentioned that in all the parking refunds he had processed, he had never had to ask someone to fill out this form.  So, yes, there IS another way, and clearly it had been used up until sometime around last week. \n\nSo he says he is submitting my comments to the Arizona Center and it is out of his hands.  His organization sold me the fraudulent parking pass, so it is VERY MUCH in his hands to refund me $18 by check, and it is ENTIRELY his responsibility. \n\nBy the way, I found out after the fact that there are cheaper garages nearer the theater, too.", "stars": 1}
{"text": "I have never been treated so poorly by an establishment in my entire life.  I am not an account holder at this bank, and after today will absolutely never even consider being one.  I went in to make a deposit to another person's account, and not having an account myself, I was forced to use some strange ATM in the lobby that had someone in Delaware on a screen trying to assist me. I put my large sum of money into the deposit slot, as directed, and after several seconds, one bill popped back out. A person in the bank came over and had a private conversation on a phone attachment with the person in Delaware and several minutes later she told me to go deposit the money that had come back out of the machine with the teller, who was an actual live person. This was about 25 minutes after I arrived at the bank to make a 5 minute transaction. I went in search of the lady who sent me to the teller and ended up spending an additional 45 minutes in an office while she punched numbers into a phone (apparently she doesn't rate talking to a live person either). Turns out the person who has the account I was attempting to make the deposit into has to file a dispute with the bank to find out where the money is. They flatly refused to give me any sort of receipt or acknowledgement that my cash was in their broken machine. I was sent on my way with a post-it note with the transaction number hand-written on it, the knowledge that the account holder is now burdened with filing a dispute, and an apology. I put over $1000 in their machine and left the building OVER AN HOUR LATER with NO RECEIPT and NO MONEY. \n\nTo sum up, if you don't bank here, they won't do you the courtesy of speaking with you unless something goes wrong with their machines.

About 35 minutes after I ordered, someone came out and told me that they were waiting on just one more item. This does not bode well for the condition of the other items that were presumably already complete and ready. Meanwhile, order after order after order of takeout for other people was brought out. Nobody offered me a beverage or even an apology. When my food finally came out after literally FIFTY-FOUR MINUTES, I was still offered no apology until I pointed out the time frame to the cashier. All she said was \"sorry.\"  If they really wanted my repeat business they would have given me a reason to return, such as a coupon. When I got home, I found that my pepper steak was hot, my kung pao chicken nearly hot, and all my noodles and rice were only lukewarm. After re-heating food that I had paid $27 to already be hot, I found it to be bland and visually unappealing, and my family agreed. I have absolutely no idea where all the positive reviews on here have come from. Bland food, hour-long cook time, and zero customer service add up to me NEVER RETURNING to this so-called restaurant.", "stars": 1}

They come in three varieties - dark roast (black bag), medium roast (silver bag), and decaf (green bag). \n\nThough we often try beans from reputed cafes throughout the city, we keep defaulting back to the Espresso Planet beans (dark roast for us!) as they offer a nice, oily bean (translation: great crema), store longer, and come in at about half the cost of beans from specialty coffee stores. You can also sign up for their loyalty program which means 1 free bag of beans for every 8 bags purchased. \n\nThe only drawback would be their location, which is more of a commute for downtown Toronto residents. \n\nTip: Although they offer both 8 oz. and 2 lb. sizes, we forgo the minor cost savings and stick to buying multiple 8 oz. bags to ensure a fresher bean for our coffee.", "stars": 4}

The waiter and kitchen were extremely accommodating as one individual of our group was celiac (gluten-free) and the other being pescetarian (vegetarian + fish). They were able to swap items in and out of the tasting menu to accommodate what they desired and needed. They even served gluten-free bread for the one member of the party and reassured her that each dish was gluten-free. The d\u00e9cor was quite nice and gives you a feel that you're in a remote cottage somewhere.

For some of the items in tasting menu, I found it to be a bit bland and required more seasoning. A good example would be the \"Pomme de Terre\" - while the lobster was very well cooked, there was a lack of cream and seasoning which made the potatoes dry and tasteless. However, the dish that stood out for me and that was the cod, mussel and shrimp dumpling in a consomm\u00e9 (dish may change with the season). The fish was perfectly cooked and all the items on the plate were propped up with carrots to prevent them from getting soggy in the consomm\u00e9 - very well thought out and well executed dish. As they were in season, we had white truffle added to some of our dishes. They were fragrant and added another dimension to the dish. Not many restaurants in Toronto offer white truffles during the holiday season, so this was a very nice addition. I think the desserts are an area of opportunity for the restaurant. The donuts that came with the tasting menu were good, but were not too sophisticated or inspired.

I usually am not that picky when it comes to the dining experience, but when the meals were close to and over $1000, I hoped for at least satisfactory service.

Probably more impressive than the cr\u00e8me brulee that is another dessert option. \n\nThe pork belly appetizer that we also ordered was melt-in-your-mouth and incredibly flavourful.  \n\nI think this restaurant does well with their Winterlicious menu as it definitely showcases good execution and great ingredients without breaking the bank. \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"", "stars": 4}

Then there's the huge Dairy Queen sign and much, much more. When you're seated, your menu is printed on the back of a record album cover. Kitch. But in a good way.\n\nIf you can't find a \"grown up\" grilled cheese to select from the menu, you're just being too picky. Even as a somewhat picky eater, I found plenty to choose from. My wife and I definitely weren't up to The Melt Challenge (over 5 pounds of cheese, bread, and more) and decided to split a Wake & Bacon (fried eggs, bacon, and cheese) and a Westside Monte Cristo (honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss, and american battered and deep fried). We also ordered a Melt Pierogi on the recommendation of the server.\n\nWe're certainly not pierogi experts, but we enjoyed Melt's version as a nice starter before our sandwiches came out.\n\nWhen our sandwiches were delivered, both my wife and I were amazed at the amount of food. Along with the hand cut fries and sweet slaw, our sandwich plates were overflowing with food.\n\nBite after bite, both of us enjoyed our sandwiches. They were both as advertised and were a nice, grown-up version of the all-American favorite grilled cheese.\n\nHonestly, we don't know what the slaw tasted like. By the time we finished our sandwiches and a good amount of our fries, we just didn't have room to eat any more food. For the price, the amount of food is a ridiculously good value. College students could easily get 3 or 4 meals out of a single plate.\n\nThe only downside to Melt Bar & Grilled is the parking situation. It's a bit confusing if you're not from the area. We parked on the road at a meter (after hours) and were fine, but there are a ton of parking rule signs you have to read to make sure you're okay.

When we first walked in we thought it looked cute, then we began noticing things like the dirty tables and floors that were not being cleared. We were sat at a poorly cleaned table and given sticky menus. They dropped water and chips at our table quickly and then we didnt see our server for several long minutes. The bar was a sore site to look at. Even from a raised chair I couldn't see what alcohol they had. I wasn't enticed to buy anything. The bar counter itself looked extremely dirty as well. I would not have eaten there. The host acted as the bar tender and it was clear he was not trained as a bar tender. He was placing his hands and fingers in dishes and mixes where they should not have been. Their margaritas looked so weak that you could see straight through them. Most drinks were served out of a machine instead of being mixed by a bar tender. The ceiling had wires sticking out of it and there were fridges with open sides that looked gross. Nothing was lit in the bar. It was the last thing anyone would focus on in the restaurant. The cook ran our food to us, and it was apparent that it had been sitting for a while. The plate was extremely hot and the cheese was melted and burned so bad I had to use a steak knife to cut it. I ordered two beef tacos and my date ordered a guacamole tostada with sour cream on the side. My beef tacos were the most tasteless thing I've eaten in a while. I'm not sure how you can make beef so bland and tasteless. The guacamole tostada came with extra guacamole instead of sour cream. It looked like a plate of guacamole with a few beans visible on the side. My date wanted the sour cream she ordered and some lemons, but never even had the chance to request them as we were not checked on a single time after we got our food. Our waters and soda were never refilled, and no service was actually provided. Once we were done we waited just under 20 minutes to be able to pay our bill. We made it blatantly clear we were ready to go and nothing, no one checked on us. Their flan sounded good but I didn't want to wait an hour for an order. When we were finally able to pay, the server, previously absent until now, stood at our table with an iPad we had to pay on until we paid. We were not able to comfortably talk about paying the bill or tipping. The server was nowhere to be found when we needed service, however he wouldn't leave us once they wanted money.

Other members of table chose the Thai Grapefruit Martini which after having sampled this gem, will be my next drink at this hip place. Dinner concluded with the Inside Out Quinoa Burger which is something you just don't see anywhere and is as healthy as it is delicious. Despite being a big meat eater the size and sustenance of this vegetarian entree was fabulous. It was a lacking a bit in flavor and I might recommend a touch of heat to spice things up but you definitely won't leave hungry. Other Entree's included the Ancient Grains bowl which was, by far, the most flavorful pick of our visit and will be my next choice when I return. The amount of flavor they packed into the dish was pleasantly surprising.\n\nFinally, when visiting True Foods I would opt for their specialty entrees and steer away from the pizza's which were mediocre at best according to one other member of the party who went with Margherita Pizza.

He neglected to ask what my model number was (1.5 yr old front-load dryer) when I made the appointment. He scheduled for Sat, showed up late, and did not have the proper belt for my model. He couldn't get one on a Sat, said he'd be back on Monday (I worked from home that day). He did not get the belt that day, and had to get it the following day--which meant I had to get permission to work from home a 2nd day. It sounded like a gorilla was banging around a drum set in my basement. He had no idea how to even get the top off of my model. Once he figured that out, he had to call tech support to find out how to replace the belt. Again, it sounded like hellfire from my basement. His original quote was $145--but charged my $175 \"because the belt was more expensive\". Well, I checked the price online later--he lied--the belt was on par with belts for all other front-load dryer models. Then, when I went to dry the clothes I had waited 2 weeks to wash, the dryer started clanking. He not only forgot to put the top on and screw it back into place, but the screws were nowhere to be found! I called him (Bill, by the way) only to find out that they were in his pocket.

I was soo disappointed already. Dessert was the only better part of the whole experience, it was really good actually. Well thats about food. The service: this waiter had no welcoming attitude, no smile no nothing. He comes to my table to clear the food, and takes my plate in his hand clears all the scrap from the plate right beside the table into his cleaning basket with his knee on my opposite chair. I was like, wtf!?? I felt disgusted. You dont have to be a huge hotelier to understand such fundemental aspects of a waiting job. At one point I was working as a waiter and I never would do that. Now the ambience: they basically play crappy, cheesy indian dance and sing routines from the 70's and 80's and that too in full volme. I dont expect them to get all classy and play dire straits or eric clapton, but i could use some soothing bollywood music. I am never going back there. I reccommend/ suggest/forbid people from even thinking about going to this place. Save your weekend, Instead try other Indian restaurants like tamarind in oakland(the best i had so far) or India palace in downtown or even the indian restaurant on atwood street.", "stars": 1}

Wow- she is rude, spent all her time trying to upsell me when I specifically said I just wanted to get my forehead done.  Finally I caved in and got double the units I originally intended to get.  When she realized I wasn't going to purchase more she told me I was only there because I couldn't afford it without a Groupon and sulked like an angry child.  I wish I had just asked for a refund because she hurriedly did a few injection sites and  I had these huge lumps (and large bruises which I had never experienced before or since).  She handed me a frozen water balloon to apply to the lumps and walked out without a word.

It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. We were put in a dark corner under one of the many TVs, but it was turned down so it wasn't too distracting.\nOur server was pleasant enough (at first) but seemed overwhelmed by having to wait on us and the other 2 (or 3?) tables in her station. She couldn't seem to get it together. Getting our drinks seemed to be a challenge (\"the bar is really busy\") and the food took an extraordinarily long time. When it did arrive the salads and soups came out with the entrees. We sent the salads and soups back...we really wanted those as a first 'course'. The food was okay, but when one of our party took a bite of his pulled pork sandwich and pulled a piece of plastic wrap out of his mouth, we really had enough. We had to ask for waters (twice) and salad dressing for a salad that came out dry. The manager came out & apologized for the plastic wrap issue and took that meal off our bill & tried a halfhearted humorous approach (though it would have cost him A LOT more if someone would have choked on that bit of plastic).\nThis is really a nice space, but the folks at Oak Barrel need to get it together.

HH was just down the street from the vacation rental so off I went. \n\nThe sign by the pumps says basic wash/vacuum is $13. But the pump was going to charge me $14. Inside I went with questions. It's $14 for trucks which included my old JC which I found odd since it's smaller than many cars. But ok, I can do that.\n\nOil change? $41 with all fees and taxes and it includes the $14 wash. That's a good deal. 45 minutes for both is what he tells me.\n\n50 minutes later the oil change tech comes in to tell me the oil will be $64 because of high miles. Nope, I say, just the regular oil. Off he goes. I've now been waiting 50 minutes and he hasn't even started the oil change. \n\nGo to check out and I'm told it's $46 for the oil change plus environmental and taxes we are now at $52.

The spring rolls were bland, and the Pad Thai was even worse. It was likely prepared by someone with limited knowledge of Thai cuisine, and tasted as if someone had doused the noodles in ketchup, and then stirred in some green onions. Old, frozen shrimp in the dish added an element of unpleasant fishyness. Could I taste a hint of that nice sourness that tamarind paste delivers? Not at all. Served with a lemon?

Right after I came in a beautiful blond came in with her infant child and husband. They were clearly on the list after us. \n\nSo 15 to 20 minutes comes and goes and I notice that the blond is seated before us. The owner, very nice guy, told me we would be seated soon, and proceeded to seat other people in front of us. If it were not for my son who was very hungry, I would have walked out. But I kept my mouth shut and we were finally seated. \n\nThe waitress was probably the best part of the experience. My son ordered a 14oz rib eye that was very thin and seemed to be loaded with tenderizer. I BBQ rib eye steaks close to once a week and it is our favorite cut, and this was substandard. The menu said choice of potato and my son ordered the sweet potato fries and we got an up charge. He also ordered onions and mushrooms which were not on the steak and which we had removed from the check. \n\nI got 1/2 BBQ chicken which I liked a lot. \n\nI told this story to people at work and they suggested I post on Yelp. I gave it a week to allow myself to think about it because this place is the owners livelihood, and I take the reviews seriously. But after going to a number of other restaurants, and being treated respectfully, I think the review is necessary to let the owner know that in this age of the Internet you cannot get away with treating people that way. \n\nSo if you are a regular at Ricks, and are seated a head of other people, enjoy the privilege. If you are not and want a good meal and be treated respectfully, you may want to check out some of the other fine establishments in the area.", "stars": 1}

However, it doesn't mean the quality of their sashimi/sushi is the best!\n\nCons\n- Service is terrible (everyone knows this, but if you aren't looking for fine dining in Mississauga, you'll be okay to put up with their service).\n- Their sashimi is not the freshest and not the highest grade. Remember, there are different types of sashimi grade and this is definitely not it. Places like Sushi Tei have better quality fish, but on the other hand lack the diversity of rolls that Hinote has. \n- Oh, did I mention service is terrible? \n\nExample to Exemplify Bad Service \nMy friends and I ordered at least 150 dollars worth of rolls (hey we like to eat), and we ordered two spicy tuna rolls, thinking it would be as amazing as their spicy salmon roll. WRONG. We all had a bite, and thought the fish tasted really fishy (for those out there saying well DUH - sashimi is suppose to taste fishy! Incorrect. When fish is fresh, it won't taste or smell \"fishy\" (ask GORDON RAMSEY). However, this tasted really off and we wanted to sent the other spicy tuna roll back. \n\nThe server consulted with their sushi chefs, and came back telling us we were wrong on the following grounds:\n\n(1) there is a difference between not liking something and something tasting bad, not fresh \n\n(2) we probably haven't been here before but this is how they make it. \n\nWe asked him did he try it? He proceeded to say no he did not but there is no way that this roll is not fresh. Can we say customer service is crap? Whatever, after insulting us that we don't what good sushi tastes like (hello - have you heard of Ja BIstro? Antonio Park?), we decided we weren't going to ruin a good night out, so said okay we'll take it back with no intentions of eating it. However, they realized they might have made a mistake and came back to take it away saying they wouldn't charge us for it, but charged for the first roll. Perfect - maybe they should have done all of that before insulting us.\n\nThis experience has left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm all about supporting family businesses, which Hinote clearly is, but I cannot accept ignorance when a customer is telling you something is not fresh (we didn't send back the other 15 rolls we ordered!). We all decided we would never go back to Hinote, b/c there are just way better quality sushi/sashimi out there, even in the burbs, that their customer service is just not worth enduring.", "stars": 1}
{"text": "Friend and I wanted to try something different (both of us been to GUU and love it), but were in the area. The atmosphere was nice and the sight of Japanese people made us think \"GEEE this place must be awesome, even Japanese people are coming to eat here\". However, I think the Japanese patrons were really there for their impressive list of sake and were smart enough to not eat here b/c we were thoroughly disappointed with the quality of food and service. It was so disappointing that we will NEVER come back here again. \n\nQuality of Food - It wasn't great. The food wasn't exactly fresh (i.e. half egg filled with bland egg salad w/a cold piece of bacon sticking from the side of it) and it wasn't exactly unique. GUU definitely is worth the wait as the food is always fresh and tasty. Nothing we had exactly made an impression on us. We left feeling hungry!\n\nHygiene - We were seated at the bar. We had a full view of the kitchen and the chefs preparing the food. The chef responsible for making udon kept sampling the food to see if it was ready (nothing wrong with that but if you made it a billion times, shouldn't you know approximately when it is ready). What REALLY disgusted us was the chef who marinated the ginger chicken (it was decent - not really as crispy as you would expect deep friend chicken, and nothing you couldn't get else where) with his hands, which we are pretty sure he didn't wash. Have they heard of a thing called SALMONELLA? Definitely saw him touching cooking utensils and frying pans w/out washing them. The kitchen is getting old, despite them just opening in last year or so and just really unappealing to patrons sitting at the bar. \n\nQuality of Service - Nice staff but too short-staffed and not attentive. Our waitress couldn't speak english (nothing wrong with that), but was distracted throughout our order b/c she was too focused on the dishes being served. We also tried to pay, but the interact machine failed to receive a signal. Waiter went away, we assumed he was trying to fix the problem, but then we saw him doing other stuff. Shouldn't he come back to tell me what the situation was? Finally, a waitress assisted us after me complaining and she said wireless was not working. She told me to use the ATM in the restaurant (NO - I'm not paying the fee) or wait for 20 minutes until it works again.  I told her that neither of those options were viable, and within 1 minute, she got the machine to work again. Makes me wonder if there was even a problem. \n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT (esp if you are going for food, can't speak for the sake).

Both times, I was not super impressed with their burgers. \n\nPros: \n- The staff is very nice and always friendly\n- Tater Tots are not bad but you can always buy your own bag of McCains\n- The services is relatively quick (you can be in and out in an hour)\n\nCons\n- The burgers are very greasy (I know, burgers are not suppose to be super healthy, but doesn't mean the buns are gleaming with grease) \n- The burgers are put together very haphazardly. I had the original burger and turkey thanksgiving burger. Both times, I need a billion napkins, which they graciously give, to clean up the sauce that is oozing out the burger. I get the need to have sauce on a burger, but not to the point where it is coming out from all sides of the bun and making your bun soggy. \n- The burgers just don't match up to some of the great burger joints in Toronto like Burger Priests, Parts and Labour or even franchises like Milestones or Jack Astors. \n- The wait times to get a spot. I got it when they first opened, but as I seen in the reviews below, no matter what time or day, even if the restaurant is not at full capacity, you will have to wait while their staff cleans the tables. It seems they have a very inefficient way of running things, they don't have a bus boy/girl cleaning up the mess. The hostess is often running around spraying tables, cleaning up messes and setting up tables. Often, you see a table where the servers have clearly used as a dumping ground for unclean glasses.  This turns me off, but what really sets a bad taste in my mouth when there are CLEAN TABLES AVAILABLE FOR SEATING, but your servers are slow in setting the table!  So, Mark, why am I waiting to be seated when you have tables for seating?\n\nOverall, Toronto is a mecca for great dining.

Adding insult to that injury was the fact that the first two \"layers\" were simply one layer of a lasagne noodle in top of another lasagne noodle; no sauce, meat, nor cheese in between, just a doubly thick layer of that dense pasta.  The sauce, meat, and cheese tastes were all delicious and as remembered, but the pasta, nope.  Has something changed between then and now?  If so, please change it back!

{"text": "I sent my 16 year old  son here to get four new tires on his car. He had saved up his money  and made this purchase on his own. I had trusted Discount Tire to help my son. They sold my son very over priced tires with a warranty. Within two months the front tires started to brake apart. He went back in to use the warranty he paid for and the manager denied his claim. Stating \" the car needed a alignment and that is what caused the issue\" They never told my son about getting a alignment. Discount does not do this service. The best information I can find says you must align your tires when you buy new ones. Why would a tire company not do alignments is puzzling unless the intent is to make you keep buying tires. We will never return to Discount and I strongly urge others to be aware of the scam.", "stars": 1}

When the pork buns finally came out, one at a time, and they were hard and inedible. By that time, everyone had completed their meal and my sister was not interested in her meal. I asked the manager to remove the buns, she apologize and said she would, but the check was presented with the buns. At that point, the server, Johnny L, was scared, and stopped coming to the table. He wasn't attentive anyways. We had other servers stop by the table more times than he did. The \"manager\", Vy, was too busy talking it up with her friends, to assist us.

I also tried the beef dry pot since I like dry pots, and we all thought the beef one was better than the lamb (it's made the same way but we just like beef more).  The dry pot has bean sprouts at the bottom which I think makes a nice contrast to the spicy beef (it helps to lessen the spiciness and add a crunch).  As for the tofu dish, I ended up liking it as well, but it wasn't what I thought I had ordered.  It's completely my fault though since I don't speak mandarin or read Chinese.  I was thinking by the English description \"fried tofu with pepper sauce\" that it would be cubes of crunchy fried tofu with a dipping sauce on the side, not a stir-fry with vegetables.\n\nMy only warning about this place is that if you are like me, and don't speak or read Chinese, you will find it more difficult to speak with the waitress and read the menu.  I'm ok with trying new things though so it's not a big deal to me.  Also you might feel a little uncomfortable among a full restaurant of Chinese speakers.

The bath spout in the shower [the one with the pull tab for the shower switch] was constantly dripping to the point of having black mold on it. The floor tiles looked like the grout work was done by a blind man, and the walpaper was not even cut evenly along the seams. I know I cant really complain about a comped room; however this point is merely an observation on the up-keep of the hotel.\n\n\nIf I had to pay for the comped room I would rate it quite low for the disgusting black mold in the shower; however the curtious check-in clerk warrants a higher star rating this time.\n\n\nFor budget minded people the Four Queens is a good choice.", "stars": 4}

{"text": "Dirty rooms are one thing, but my most recent trip was beyond mike rowe dirty it was that bad.\n\nI get to the hotel with my printed out reservation for a deluxe room. Its not the cheapest, but it not the most expensive. Anyways an argument ensued about the room not being available[I held my cool until they tried to BS me]. I told them I booked a dexluxe room and you want to put me in the cheap room? They said that is all they have. So I said to the check in clerk \"If that is all the rooms you have, then what about the hundred people behind me\"? The clerk replied \"they have different reservations\". \n\nSo without totally going ape s^&t I took the capri room and honestly I would prefer to sleep in a porto potty it was that dirty!\n\nI can forget the rude clerk trying to use the bait and switch; but the crap[literally] in the room is unexceptable. Maybe I can look past the water spots in the bathroom indicating they did not clean it at all; but that was the tip of the iceberg. The wall of the hotel room actually had a hole in it the size of a grapefruit. The room had an overall musky odor, and it appeared that no one had made the beds properly. Not to mention the thing that was the death nail for me or anyone else would be the 'stain' on the wall. Yes; I said stain. On the wall opposite the grapefruit sized hole was a smear that looked like someone took a used female hygine product and covered it with feces when they threw it up aganist the wall it was that disgusting.\n\nOf course I immediatly got on the hotel phone and spoke with the manager on duty. I told him of all the crap in the room I was staying in and all that he said in response wah \"ah-huh.....ah-huh\"; in a tone that he did not believe me. When I saw that it would not be likely I would get a different room I asked him to transfer us [me and my companion] to a sister hotel since its all part of the caesars entertainment group anyways. He [the manager] then has the nerve to tell me that if I go to the sister hotel(s) I would have the pay the difference. I said \"I would have to pay the difference in a room even though you have no new room and this one is crap\". To which he replied 'Yes'. \n\nHonestly; who would not be angry at a room with bloody feces on the wall?\n\nLong story short; I was on the verge of cancelling my resveration and calling my CC company when my companion decided to speak to the manager. Literally within 5 seconds he gave us a new room. To which she inquired \"how can you have a new room for me and not him\"? He replied \"something just opened up\"? More BS from a BS hotel.\n\nRude management that always tries to BS you; crap covered walls; NO THANKS!\n\nDO NOT STAY IN THE IMPERAL PALACE HOTEL... EVER!", "stars": 1}

{"text": "The only thing if any I liked about this hotel is the room I stayed in had the elevators across the way from the check-in desk without having to walk through the casino.\n\n\nFirst of all I would like to say that when I booked the room I knew it was going to be expensive, but I was not expecting rude and incompetent staff.\n\nI stayed on 5/15/11 and booked the room 2-3 weeks in advance. I get to the check-in desk and this cocky punk was checking me in and told me to sign in on the i-pad they had there. I told him I wanted a paper slip as proof. He got the paper slip but there was no reason for him to be an ass about it. I get the paper slip and put the whatever required deposit and then I was told to wait another 2 hours. As anyone in ths scenario would get a little angry and I proceeded to tell him that why would you take my info, CC, and deposit and not give me a room key. Again with the rude/ cocky attitude he said we have to wait until a room openes up. Needless to say I go back 2 hours later and the man at the desk tells me that you will still have to wait. At least the second time I inquired to my room status I was greeted with a very helpful and polite english man [at least he looked english to me] that explained I would have to wait longer.\n\nIt as almost 6pm when I was able to check-in.\n\nWhen I go to the room (WE 4605) I step into the elevator and I push the button and nothing happens. The other people in the elevator tell me to put my room key in the slot and select my number. You think the woman check-in clerk I finally got the room keys from would tell me that; but NO, they neglected to mention it.\n\n\nI'm tired, and a little angry at this point but I sucked it up until I got into the room. You think wating that long to be 'ready' and clean would actually make it clean, but guess again. There was actually a woman who came to the door and brought me some new lip-balm and soaps, and towles. While the soaps and towles were actually missing; I would never use the lip balm; but I looked and the seal was broken indicating who knows where someone used it on their body.\n\n\nNow you have every right to believe what you wish but every hotel I have stayed in so far [perhaps not recently with all the new rooms etc...] has always had a Gideon bible in the room. Not this one. They had other books, but no bible.  \n\nYes the bell man was very polite when he brought my bags; but when he offered to show me the remote controls, the televisions both did not work. He said he would send someone to take care of it but nothing happened. They even had a screw on the remote that would not even let you check the batteries. I could not even check into menu with my room bill, and changing the channels required manual adjustment that even did bearly work. A new hotel and the TV dont work ???\n\n\nPerhaps the death nail for anyone would be the used birth control prevention device that was laying on the floor. Needless to say I spoke to the clerk again and demanded that my room be refunded. When he refused to do it I spoke to the magager on duty about the item I found; he said obviouisly someone did not clean the room very good. I was angry at this point (like anyone would be), and told him 'you think?' Having me wait to clean the room and I find a birth control device on the floor. To add insult to injury he would only refund half the price of the room. I Would not recommend the cosmo to anyone.\n\n\nRude and incompetent staff, ultra late check-in, water spots on the glasses, missing towles, missing soap, used lip-balm, non-fuctional televisions, and used birth control prevention devices on the ground; No THANKS!\n\nDo not stay at the cosmo; EVER!", "stars": 1}

Dont get me wrong; both the waitress and the busboy were very curtious and helpful. However when my friend ordered the stake it was said to the waitress to prepare the steak medium-well with even a slight pink to be left in the center would be acceptable.\n\nThat was NOT the case. The steak was very well done and almost a borderline beaf jerky. However when the busboy went to take the steak back and perhaps have the cook [I call him a cook and not a chef] prepare another meal, I could literally hear the cook complain out loud. I knew it was about my party, cause the conversation was that loud between the cook and the busboy. \n\nI almost expected the cook to leap over the counter to my table with a butcher knife it was like that. I know sometimes that they may get upset; however it is what the customer wants; NOT what the cook/ chef say this is the way its going to be.\n\nOverall the Hotel/ casino were not all that bad, only the Pasta Pirate needs a extensive lesson in manners.\n\nYes; the steak special was taken off my bill at the end, but deliberately speaking out loud where everyone can hear you is very unprofessional.

When I left I confirmed with her the next appointment in two weeks.\n\nHowever, when I arrived for the second appointment, another person was also waiting for the same time. Glenda seemed confused and told me that I had no appointment.  I showed her original text for the time and date she had confirmed and reminded her that I had reconfirmed when I was there the last time.  I had driven about 20 miles and I was leaving in two days for vacation so I definitely needed her to honor my scheduled appointment. The previous polish was already peeling off - only lasted about twelve days.  Again, the manicure took forever (about one and a half hours), she only put on two coats of gel which didn't look as good, and again it started peeling off in less than two weeks.  \n\nI have had many gel manicures with other manicurists over the past three years and this was the only one that took over an hour and also the only one that did not last two weeks (others usually last about three weeks.)

You do not have to walk miles to get to your room or from one end of the casino to the other.  Parking is very convenient.  The location on the strip is great - across from the mall and near other nice casino properties.  It is only a short indoor stroll to the Wynn to have a larger casino and more restaurant selections.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed (although showing just a little wear and tear) and we never have heard noise from the hallways or from other guests.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  We loved the buffet - probably the best we have been to in Las Vegas.  \n\nThe only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because if you just want coffee, juice, yogurt, or a muffin in the morning the prices are high - the ventilation in the casino isn't great -  the casino seems to have tightened up on slot machine payouts - and if your room is on the Strip side you may feel or hear vibrations from the nightclub (we did one night - on the 25th floor - but we were warned about it when we checked in and chose that side of the building anyway.)  \n\nOverall, we definitely recommend the Encore for an above-average experience.", "stars": 4}

{"text": "We have been eating at Me Va Me for years, but after our last time there, we will never return. I am appalled by the experience we had and the way it was handled by management and the owner. As we have been patrons of this restaurant for many years (this location and the Steeles location prior to that), we always valued the good quality of the food as well as the consistency. I can say that I have never found the service to be spectacular, but its always fast and the servers are generally courteous. This particular time we went, we were surprised to receive only one piece of laffa bread (they would not bring more even though they always have before) and to see the large greek salad arrive with very little lettuce, and literally ONE tomato slice, and TWO very small cucumber slices. It was 1/3 of the size it normally was. I was there with 3 other people and although we found our portions substantially smaller than usual, they were still sufficient that we would not mention it to our server. When we told our server about the salad, she immediately called over the manager, \"Irena\". Irena did not introduce herself, but rather she listened to the issue and responded with \"I don't see what your problem is, that is how the salad comes\". My sister and I also had a greek salad, so we showed her ours and asked how is it possible that ours has all these vegetables and lettuce and this other salad does not? Irena began arguing with us and kept repeating that this is how the salad is and there is nothing wrong with it. We told her this is not acceptable and we are regular customers but will choose to not come back if this is the service and ridiculously sized portions we receive. Irena said \"Ok don't come back if that's what you prefer\". At this point I was shocked by how we were being spoken to and after about 5 more minutes of arguing, she took back the salad and brought it back with a few more vegetables and lettuce in it. She did not apologize, rather she continued to speak curtly to us. There was no offer of an apology, or complimentary dessert, coffee or anything for that matter for the incident that had occurred. I was so appalled by her behavior that I felt the need to report it to the owner, although this is something I have never done before. The owner listened to our experience and said he would remedy the situation immediately. He took my information and said he would call me back. That was almost 3 weeks ago and I still have not heard back from him.  The customer service is so horrendous that they do not deserve repeat customers.

In fact this store has lost a very good loyal customer for a very stupid little thing relating to customer service.\n\n\nBack in December late we took a oil lamp conversion that my grandmother had won for butter making about 100 years ago. When the farm got electricity my grandfather had converted it and it's been in my family ever since. It needed a new lamp shade so we, of course, headed to Living Lighting. After quite a bit of fiddling the custom shape and fabric was decided on and we went home to wait for it's arrival. Several weeks went by without hearing anything so I called only to find out that the order had been lost. Back we went, again, to get the order redone. At this point I was mystified how no one had remembered such a unique lamp, and how no one really thought it appropriate to apologize or offer a discount. The lampshade order was made up again, I asked if it could perhaps, because of the inconvenience, be expedited. That request was met with a blank stare.  \n\n\nMany weeks later I finally got a call that the shade was in and I dropped by to pick it up today. In looking at it I realized that the oil lamp, not being a real electric lamp, lacked attachments for it to sit on top of the bulb and the new shade didn't accomodate that. I start to feel a little sick thinking they've screwed it up again. I mention the problem to the woman serving me and get another blank stare and a comment that that is what was ordered. Now, I brought the lamp in, twice, so it's clearly not my mistake if the shade is not correct. She mentions to her co-worker the problem and the co-worker says, oh yeah, it will need a add-on converter to work. I'm left thinking that if my husband had picked it up he wouldn't have known about that and we would have had to go back to the store again!\n\n\nShe tells me the amount, and it is less than the price marked on the shade, so I comment that I must have gotten a discount for the inconvenience. What inconvenience, I get back, so I mention that the original order was lost and I actually assume I'd get a discount. I had just put $20 down, the adapter was extra, and no discount was being offered. When I went to pay, the amount had decreased so I asked again, and I was told, grudgingly, that I had indeed gotten a discount. \n\n\nAs I got to leave I then get told that the woman serving me had driven \"all day\" to get my shade, and that \"for a $50 shade\". I thank her for that selfless act and leave.\n\n\nThe last purchase at Living Lighting has been made.\n\n\nPS There must be an enormous staff at this store composed of twins and triplets because every time I get someone who has no knowledge of what has gone before but I recognize the face every time.

Theway the rep said to me this date is the one the way will pick up my stuff.\n\nMy husband took the day off, we're waiting at home for them to pick up our stuff and we decide to call them as to what time frame they were coming. They said they're coming the next date and confirmed for tomorrow. Had big fat confusion on their part and ours. I said fine it's ok, I am not too happy but as long as they pick up tomorrow. I was nice and u know wat forget arguing, we're moving that's our top priority.\n\nI requested delivery date for May 10, 2014, today is May 30, 2014. About 14 days, I was told approximately 5-10 business days for delivery.  I call them no one knows anything, only Roy does I guess. They promise they will have someone call me back, they never do I am the one following with them.  I have been more than patient with them. \n\nI need my medical bed, I explained to them how I can't sleep without my bed, they don't care enough to make me a priority.\n\nI will never recommend this company to anyone ever, if u want to have high blood sure becuz of the stress they give u plz go with them otherwise there are better companies. Plz don't waste ur time with them, they sweet talk u into how professional they are and only one complaint with better business bureau but don't fall for it. I trusted my sales person blindly and said no to the other company that was offering me better rates. The only reason I went with them was because of experience, but if driving ur customer to the point where they have to take BP meds and wish day n nite that u should have gone with the other company is professional experience then they need to take some customer service courses!!!!!\n\n\nDon't fall for their good sales service, actual service sucks!", "stars": 1}

{"text": "Pulling up I was initially greeted by a young man who really doesn't understand customer service as he says \"whats up bro\"!  As if I was his closest friend or we knew each other prior.  I'm not your bro, I'm your customer who is wanting to get help not a beer.  After I explained what was needed I had Christian come up and state that he would be able to get me in really quick for a oil change and tires rotated. He then proceeded to take me over to another gentlemen to ask for what the total costs would run with my jeep..  After this I asked how long would this take and I was told 1hr to 1 1/2hr.  I asked if there was a possibility to take me home as I had work that needed to be performed for my schooling, and they made it seem that it would be no problem and had me give them my name and said the shuttle man is on property and would take just a minute.  After waiting 50min in the lobby Christian walked by the waiting area and said let me find the shuttle man because I thought you had been gone already.... REALLY great follow through with the department scheduling the shuttle service when you have made a customer wait 50 min...  Then Robert the driver finally came and got me to take me home.  Now at this point it has been 3 hours since I dropped off my vehicle.  In addition after a 50 min wait about 20min after arriving home I received a call stating that I had a screw in one of my tires and it would be 20$ to fix so I gave the okay to fix it just to find out another 30min later they stated there were 2 screws side by side and it wouldn't be able to fix at all.. SKETCHY, for the reason how can you see one screw and not the second stating its right next to it??? I feel personally they damaged the tire after the initial phone call more and now couldn't fix it at all...  You should be able to view the tire entirely before you call a customer with stories just to finally explain they were stories and your tire is pretty much scrap.  \n\nFinally putting the nail on the head of this entire ordeal I have been waiting almost 2 entire hours to just get picked up to get my jeep back. I called and complained just to have a man repeat himself like a broken record that its a courtesy pick up... He also laughed when I told him where I live which is on TPC golf course and he said \"you could of walked here 5 times by now\".  ARE YOU SERIOUS! If he would shut up for 3 seconds instead of interrupting me as I was telling him I was told initially 1hr to be finished and then waited 50 minutes to have a shuttle take me home that was told to me the man is on property.  I was lied about my tires having 1 screw in it which turned into a magical two side by side (how can you not visually see that).  To finally be lied that my jeep was ready and the shuttle was on its way at 4:45pm to now be writing this at 6:30pm to receive another call stating that the shuttle is picking up one other woman and would be on its way to get me.  So basic oil change at Jeep Airpark dealership will take about 4 1/2hrs of your day so make sure to be prepared.  In addition try to oversee your vehicle as I never had any tire issues prior to dropping off reflecting any NAIL damage, no tire deflation or tire pressure problems.  Do no trust and will never trust again.  \n\nDiscount Tire has my new purchase in the tire I feel you damaged or told me lies about with 1 to 2 nails in the tire, and I will be finding another dealership to do my mechanic work here forward.\n\nJust received a call from the shuttle driver Robert stating he is on Bell and 32nd and your driver deserves a raise great customer service rendered the entire drive. Pleasant and hospitable with apologies which weren't his problem. \n\nUPDATE: I just arrived back home at 7:20pm after a 3pm drop off.  I would like to commend after this entire complaint your service man Christian actually staying to see me pick up my vehicle this late and help me through the completion of my process.  Comical note I had a 40$ coupon and your service department didn't even know how to apply it when its on your website.  They kept handing me paperwork stating they applied it with no difference reflecting on total cost.  Lies are the quickest way to lose trust and this place I feel has lied to me enough today to conclude any further business.\nLying on time of completion\nLying on time of shuttle service to and from (4hrs for oil change)\nLying about repairs 1 nail magically turning into 2 side by side.

July 20 after October flight we have finally received a response after a flight was canceled to be moved to the following day.  We were told initially that food hotels or any out of pocket expense will be overseen by the company and paid to a extent.  Now we were staying at our parents house so that wasn't a cost for us but our dogs back in AZ were costing us 75$ a day for each to be cared for and that's what we submitted for and also one meal.  As of today July 20 we got the response that they were declining any out of pocket expense as they suggest this was a obligation of the traveler.

Don't attempt to business with this \"business.\" The sad part is that we actually got some fairly decent cabinets from this place but they were an absolute nightmare to work with. We ordered some discontinued cabinets and had to pay in full up front. That was on a Saturday, and they were to check stock and get back with us on Monday -- since the line was discontinued, not all sizes would be available. They didn't call as promised, so we started calling late the next week and left messages since they rarely answered the phone. No one ever called back. We drove back to the store (about 20 miles away) after WEEKS -- and remember that the warehouse is selling out of the discontinued cabinets all the while. And they hadn't placed our order or even checked what was available at that point. We finally got most of the cabinets we had paid for, a few months later. They owed us a refund since we couldn't get all the cabinets, which we eventually back, but we had to DRIVE THERE AGAIN to get the money. I would gladly have paid more to not deal with these drooling morons. Don't do it! What few dollars you save won't make up for the aggravation!", "stars": 1}

Two problems with this hotel - one, there is no pull off in front of the hotel to drop people off or just check in before parking; two, if you are arriving late (after 11 pm), the door is locked and you must be buzzed in by the front desk. This wouldn't be a problem except the phone you have to use is ALWAYS blocked by luggage carts so you have to climb over them to get to the phone just to get in the hotel.

A manager of some sort came out from the back and was about to roll a trash can outside but when he saw the line he took the trash can to the back and proceeded to help out.

However, the bathrooms at the pool were very good. A campstore would be nice for camp souvenirs. The inn has some stuff but it's not the same. The nuclear power plant next door is so ugly against nature's beauty. (The lookout tower by the nature center is the best example.)

{"text": "For anyone who lives in the valley, Saba's is a name everyone is familiar with.  My husband introduced me to this mom and pop joint and I even make sure that any visitors that we have from out of state experience this restaurant.\n\nThe marvelous deal they have right now with their $5 gyro makes it extremely affordable.  For about another dollar you can add soup, salad, or fries.  I always opt for the house salad that is drizzled with a lemon vinaigrette which is rather enjoyable!  The gyro is one of the best I've ever tasted and The Chicago is even better, which has all crispy meat.  The adventurous side of myself tried Kibbeh, an appetizer that is made of ground beef, pinenuts, cinnamon and then fried.  The presentation reminded me of falafel, but the taste was very different.  Don't let yourself be scared by the cinnamon; it's subtle and remarkably delicious!  \n\nAnother all time favorite everyone needs to try is their flaming baklava.  The infamous \"fire\" show you get will impress any kid or grownup alike and eating it will be even more enjoyable.  Crispy, nutty, and honeylicious with a bit of an added zing from the burned off liquor.  Mmm, mmm, Mm.\n\nI honestly cannot praise this place enough.  It's the right price at a great location with reliable service.  The staff is always friendly and will go out of their way to make sure all of your questions are answered.  Also, if you enjoy a beer with your meal, they have a wide range to choose from without the overly-priced sticker tag.  Who can beat that?", "stars": 4}
{"text": "Over the last few weeks I've been wondering about this restaurant based on the seemingly always full parking lot.  Curious, I perused their website and was impressed.  Their claim of  \"flavorful spice\" left me intrigued, so I had to see for myself if all the conundrum was true.\n\nIt was a beautiful evening, so we decided to sit outside. However, walking through the restaurant I felt the quaintness vibe and liked the simplicity of the decorations.  The bar was down to earth and I'm pretty sure I saw Norm sitting on the corner.  It was charming.  The outside patio area comes equipped with standing heat lamps, so when the sun set behind us, we still felt very comfortable.  The fact that the patio also faced inside the shopping area was nice, so that you didn't notice the busy traffic on Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nService was very prompt and I noticed that my glass of tea and water were never allowed to reach empty.  In fact, when they asked to grab my glass I was surprised to find it half way gone.  They serve chips and salsa while you peruse the menu.  The chips are very tasty and no extra salt is needed.  The salsa on the other hand was okay.  We found out later in the meal that they had a salsa caliente, which I would highly suggest.  It was spicy, but anyone could handle it and it had more flavor than the mild salsa.\n\nTuesday is taco day.  A very good deal if you are on the lookout!  $6.95 for a choice of two tacos and a variety of fillings for any taste bud.  I tried the stacked enchiladas smothered in christmas style sauces (red and green chile), carne adovada, cheese, corn tortillas, and I topped it off with a perfectly over easy fried egg.  It was very delicious.  The pork was tender and flavorful and I'm pretty sure I was licking the plate to make sure I didn't miss anything.  I preferred the green chile sauce, but if you're not sure which way to go, like me, getting the christmas style was the way to do it!  Also, I cannot say enough about the rice.  It was the most flavorful, exciting rice I have ever gotten at a restaurant.  Gone are the days of ignoring the boring rice and beans here, so definitely make sure you try them.\n\nIf you're into happy hours, they were offering a dollar off all beers and seemed to have a good variety to choose from.  I also suggest checking out their website.  Every day something different is going on--True Blue Night, and Fresh Catch Friday, to only name a couple.  I'll definitely be checking out their blackboard specials, and perhaps stumble into a couple margaritas as well!  \n\nI was hoping to find the spice and flavor they boasted about and I left completely satisfied.  This is a great place to hang out for practically any occasion without leaving your pocketbook empty.  Why is the parking lot full, I wondered?  Because the restaurant was packed with happy customers.", "stars": 4}
{"text": "We have watched business' come and go at this location for a few years now.  When I saw that it is now a sushi restaurant, I had my reservations.  During the day you cannot see into the shop because of the tinted windows, but don't let that stop you from seeing and tasting what's inside.  \n\nWe sat ourselves at the bar and were greeted very warmly from the waitress and soon afterwords, the sushi chef.  It happened to be happy hour at the time with extremely reasonable prices.  Happy hour is everyday of the week from 4-6:30pm.  What great deals!  Sake bombers were only $6 and you can choose from a variety of appetizers; such as edamame, calamari, and gyoza, to name a few.  I had to have the edamame, and the calamari was scrumptious as well.  It was served with a yummy aioli sauce that paired with it perfectly.\n\nNot only were there appetizers on the happy hour menu, but there were some sushi rolls to choose from too.  We tried the shrimp tempura roll and wow, the shrimp had an amazing light batter that had a lovely crunch! \n\nBesides happy hour, we had to experiment more from the sushi menu.  The Surfer was amazing; that was one of my favorites.  The dynamite shrimp on top was delectable with it's spicy zing.  It was hard not to eat all the shrimp on its own without the roll!  If you like spicy, you would also like the yellow fin tuna with sauteed jalapenos.  It's served with a delightful soy garlic sauce.  It was a little misleading, because we thought it was going to be a roll.  However, it was extremely fresh and tasty, but a little overpriced for all that you got.\n\nOn the adventurous side, the quail egg was phenomenal!  It was served in a shot glass and I have to admit, I wasn't sure how to proceed.  After taking the plunge into my mouth, I found that all the components went together extremely well and the creaminess from the quail egg only added to the delicacy of it.  I would definitely get that again and perhaps experiment a little more with what else they had to offer.  \n\nI am very happy to have found a sushi bar that keeps my taste buds wanting more.  Service was excellent.  My glass never reached empty, and it was never a nuisance to stop our waitress and ask for something.  The atmosphere was mediocre.  I felt that there could have been more charm, especially with the big screen televisions playing football.  Personally, I could have done without and maybe been more entertained with anime.  However, this sushi hot spot is off to a good start and I hope they will be around longer than their predecessors.", "stars": 4}

Bring a book and just park yourself for the day. \n\nThere's usually skateboarders or bikers/runners in the area, and people walking along the water, so it's great for people watching. If the beach/sand area is packed, you can hang out on the grassy little hills.\n\nTip: Come before 12, before it gets busy, to grab chairs (which are chained to the umbrellas). Even if you can't grab a chair, just throw down a blanket on the sand and enjoy the lake views. There's also a water fountain nearby if you get thirsty and want to fill up.", "stars": 4}

It used the same chopped egglant with tahini as on our Salatim plate -- when it really should be fried eggplant. It  also had apple and brussels sprouts. Nothing was mixed in the pita, it was just layers so you didn't get a variety of ingredients in each bite. The whole sandwich was just too mushy and overflowing. Wouldn't order it.\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS:\n-You should definitely go! \n-Get the Salatim, and try the hummus. Skip the Sabih.\n-Nahal '83 cocktail was great.", "stars": 4}

The waitress was by a couple of times to check in but generally left us alone (which I appreciate) and we never ran out of water at our table. \n\nI ordered their BBQ Burger which rang in at $11 and came with only a small bowl of their marinated kale slaw as a side. The burger patty itself was nothing to write home about. It  was well seasoned but it was thin and a touch dry. It was however redeemed by the excellent quality produce on top (tomatoes, banana peppers, etc.) and, best of all, the quinoa crusted onion rings. For me the overall experience of the burger was rather average, at $11 for an a-la-carte burger I know I expect a lot more but since I am unfamiliar with the general quality of vegetarian burgers my opinion my be off the mark. The slaw it was served with was another matter, it was made with quality ingredients and had wonderful texture but was completely bland. All in all it was an enjoyable but rather forgettable meal for me. If I were to go back, the bowls and wraps looked intriguing. I realize it sounds like I am slamming the food but I did actually enjoy it, I would have much fewer criticisms if the price was a few dollars lower or came with an actual side.\n\nIn the end I doubt I would return here on my own but I wouldn't object if it was suggested when out with my friends.\n\nP.S.

I have never had a wait staff say \"thank you\" and \"you're welcome\" more than this. They even joked with me as I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my delayed guest. (I used this time to read other Yelp reviews for my meal selection.) I can only hope that service is like this at all times. For my money it doesn't get any better here.\n\nFood: C\nUnfortunately the food wasn't as good as the service. I got the chicken parmesan after reading that the salads were less than overwhelming. I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day. (on the other hand, I did once have the lasagna here and I remember it being tasty).\n\nQuite frankly, for me the Olive Garden is a better Italian experience, even with all of its chain restaurant failings. I can forgive bad service if the food is great (the tip is an interesting invention) but not the other way around. My search for a go-to Italian restaurant will continue, though I can't say I won't be back if I get another invitation.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "Ehhhhh...I just don't know. I've dined in at this Claim Jumper about twice a month for the past 8 months that I've resided in Vegas, and probably ordered the take out another 5-10 times or so when I was working more frequently in Town Square. Everything here is so unbelievably inconsistent, that it's hard to give this place a solid rating. When the food is good and the service is good, this place is definitely 4-5 stars. But when its bad...boy is it bad. \n\nClaim Jumper has an excellent menu and dessert selection. This is their strength and weakness - they offer a little of everything for everyone while specializing in absolutely nothing. They also offer a full service bar that's pretty handy to grab a Stoli Cranberry when you're waiting for a table on a Saturday night. And the drinks are pretty darn good, especially when this blonde guy Chris is in the bar. He makes a mean martini - the kind that makes me shamelessly fall off my bar stool when I get up to follow the hostess to my awaiting table.\n\nThe servers are hit or miss. I've had a few that were friendly and talkative and gave me free dessert for being a sweetheart. I've also had some that were outright hostile by slamming a plate or cheese toast on the table or rolling their eyes and groaning when I meekly asked for a refill of iced tea. Luckily, I've found a server that is polite, friendly, and thorough, so I just request him when I go in. \"Are you sure you're willing to wait 40 minutes for a table with him, ma'am?\" Why yes, yes I am; I've got my appletini right here to entertain me.\n\nThe food for the most part is mediocre and generally lukewarm by the time it reaches the table. But the portions are ridiculously huge. I order off the Little Jumper's menu most of the time (when I have a server that's willing to accomodate that), and even then I end up taking about half of it home. I've had a variety of different dishes (lobster, steak, turkey dinner, burger, pizza, country fried steak, etc.), and I find I'm disappointed most of the time. Their mini pizzas and sliders are phenomenal though.\n\nDecor is nice enough. Booths are comfy. Bathrooms are clean. Outdoor spring/summer seating looks nice. The music that plays is mostly 80s and is completely awesome. It's half the fun of going there.\n\nLunch take-out has proven to be a worthless joke for me. Despite ordering 15-20 minutes before I even jaunt on over there for pick up, half the time they forget to put my order in, and the other half of the time something happens in the kitchen and it has to be completely remade. I appreciate the quality checks the staff makes before handing my order over to me, but I'm starving. It's just one freaking soft pretzel! Pleeeeeeaaaasssseeee feed me...I only have 5 minutes left on my lunch!\n\nWorth noting are their fantastic managers. If something goes wrong, they're there at your table to make sure it gets done right. They're very friendly and on top of things.\n\nSo there you have it. Some good points, and some bad. I've put up with it, mostly because it was easy and a comfortable routine for my husband and I. But recently we discovered \"I Love Sushi\" so I think that's going to seriously cut into our Claim Jumper visits. Which is absolutely fine by both of us.", "stars": 3}

Problem is, the food is nothing to get excited over. It has a hint of authenticity, but has been extremely Americanized. The gyros were okay, and the hummus and tzatziki were passable. The pitas were far too dry and tasteless, so they served solely as a vehicle for the mediocre dips. The garlic sauce on my shawerma was very strange...I didn't hate it with a vengeance like other yelpers did, but I honestly couldn't decide if I liked it or not.\n\nThe interior was decent and cozy, but definitely had the \"college hangout\" vibe. Which is fine, of course, as long as you're okay with that. As many others mentioned, there is a hookah lounge too.\n\nCustomer service was mediocre to start, but warmed up throughout the visit.\n\nSurprisingly, the fries were the best part: Perfectly seasoned, thick cut, and extra crispy.\n\nI'll probably return, due to proximity and price.

We also split the waygu burger which was one of the specials. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bacon jam and egg really were a wonderful combination. The homemade chips were lovely and not too greasy. One of the girls in our party had the brick oven chicken and she was pleased with the chicken as well as the mac & cheese it was served with. By the time we were ready for dessert service had slowed considerably as the restaurant had filled up some more. It really seemed to get busy the later in the evening it got.

I understand this is not within the restaurants control however I would certainly prefer to have an option rather than shared dining but as a party of two we were not afforded that luxury. \n\nService - The first visit they were busy but by sitting at the bar we were able to flag down the bartender to get our orders relatively fast. The second visit I arrived first and my server asked if I would like to wait to order, I informed him I would order before my companion arrived but I needed a minute to look over the menu. After waiting for him to return for some time I turned awkwardly around from my place at the bar extension to place my order for a drink with the bartender.

My last few experience here (for dinners) were less than wonderful but I had good memories of the baked goods so thought it would be a good breakfast spot. \nWe were early (8:30a) so our service was great, our coffee never ran low. I ordered the crab cake Benedict and was disappointed. The spinach was not seasoned at all and the small drip of hollandaise sauce was lumpy; the seasoned potatoes were bland. My boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash (one of his favorites for breakfast) the corned beef was clearly not fresh-made and came out as a slab of beef. The highlight of our breakfast was the apple streusel muffin that came with his breakfast. It was hot and gooey and we both really liked it. Sadly the muffin and service do not make up for the rest of the mediocre breakfast and we will not be returning.", "stars": 2}

After the first 2 months of Weekly shopping one day after a hard day's work I decided to grab a few cold one's to relax over the weekend, as any law abiding grocery store would do the cashier ask's for my ID so I more than gladly handed it to her but all of a sudden she says \"Cali?

This cashier totally ruined my afternoon that day, at that point my wife and I were weekly shoppers and found every other cashier pleasant to checkout with! This cashier needs to be re-trained or let go. #1...a business is a reflection of it's employees #2..without customers a business cannot survive! Period! #3...if I am purchasing products from your store I don't pay to hear your personal opinions about where I am from! After a year and a half I still shop here but I avoid that cashier at all cost! She is pernicious to the Fry's company as a whole and if she is that blunt who knows what other vile things she might be saying to other customers at fry's on main and Greenfield.

Our bartender would walk past empty drinks several times and not bother to ask if we'd like a refill.

She actually tended to three new customers and cashed them out before even getting our checks from the time our entire meal was done. The only positive I can mention is the mashed potatoes were good.

It was hassle free and relatively quick compared to other dealerships. Here's the rub. A coupe of weeks ago we got a flat tire in the middle of nowhere on the way to New Mexico. No worries. I can put on the spare and get the tire replaced. Not so fast. There was no spare or even a jack. I was perplexed. I have never purchased a car that didn't include a spare tire or a jack. It never even dawned on me to check. In hindsight, I should have checked. I took it for granted. Needless to say, we had to call for help. I sent an email to the dealer a few days later and received a call from the sales manager. The conversation was brief. I was told the car came with run flat tires that will go about 50 miles and that the spare tire is an upgrade option. I was never told this. The sales manager was sure he mentioned it to me. I can assure you he did not. I was also told it would cost $2000 to add the package or I could just buy a spare myself and put it in the trunk. Those are my options. Ok. I can promise you infinity of Scottsdale will not get $2000 more from me. The general manager did reach out also, but again, no real resolution.

After we showed up for our RESERVATION we waited another 10 minutes. We were sat on a very busy night, and I'm trying to keep that in mind. Our female server had little to no interest in serving us - intent on keeping an eye on all her tables. She wouldn't even look us in the eye. Never. Made. Eye contact. My dad is REALLY hard of hearing and asked her to repeat herself. She actually got exasperated. Like...huffed. I'm sorry - look around. That's your clientele. People can't hear. Especially on a busy night.\n\nWe ordered, and felt supremely RUSHED. Our dishes were constantly being taken away from us before we were even finished. I ordered the Mahi Mahi, the nights \"special\" - I swear I have seen the exact same dish at Bangle Barbeque in Disneyland. And paid about $15 LESS. \n\nIt's pretty sad that the best thing I had that night was the free liver pate. That stuff was amazing. So...yay liver.\n\nWe ordered drinks, appetizers, and desserts READ - $$$ - and yet all our server was looking at were the more expensive LOOKING tables. Older gents in suits. Not a family. \n\nNow, I'm aware this is mostly about the server - but isn't that the face of a restaurant? I had a HORRIBLE time - the server severely negatively impacted our entire meal. It was my last weekend visiting my folks. It was awful.\n\nAfter we paid, we actually went into the bar - hoping to not feel so rushed and relax with each other a little while. It almost felt like it was something the management told everyone to do: servers, bussers, runners - everyone was RUSHING. There was no time to enjoy anything.\n\nWell, the BAR was an entirely different story. We had a GREAT time, stayed a couple hours! Didn't feel rushed, patrons were happy and everyone was having a great time, as was the bartender! I noted to myself that if I HAPPEN to ever come back, I will sit in the bar. It made a horrible night, sting a bit less.\n\nThe place is good for sports fans I guess and people in a hurry - or who have money to intimidate, but if you're looking for a great meal, and an enjoyable time, save your money and dignity.

{"text": "Not a bad place for a burger and a drink, but not great either.\n\nTo summarize the pros and cons of my experience:\n\nCons: 1. Sticky tables, 2. Dirty looking silver ware 3. Cool beer, not cold beer.\n\nPros: 1. Good Food, 2. Nice and attentive staff 3. Sports on TV 4. Free Wifi\n\nI went to the Roadrunner off Buffalo and Washington around 4:10 on Saturday 4/6/13. I walked in and sat myself as a sign instructed and was promptly greeted by the Manager on duty. He brought a water and he took my order. I asked for the 1/3 lb Angus Burger and a draft Sam Adams Boston lager. I prefer draft instead of bottled because draft is colder, usually.\n\nLooking around its what you would expect from a local's oriented sport bar. Dim, sticky and sports on TV. The table I sat at was pretty sticky and the silver ware, though clean, had a lot of water spots on it and looked a little gross. They had Wichita vs Louisiana on, no volume though which was ok with me because I think Charles Barkley's voice is annoying. Also they didn't have the captions on so I had no idea what anyone was saying, but I don't really care that much about it.\n\nAbout another 3 minutes later I was brought a bottle of Sam Adams Boston lager instead of a draft by a very kind waitress. Even though I ordered a draft I didn't make a stink about it  because hey, beer! Taking another look around, the place was clean and if you like antique-ish looking cowboy stuff and garb this place is your mecca. There are cowboy hats, western style art and nick-nacks on the walls; even rusty looking horse shoe light fixtures. Also they had a sign that said free WiFi, which is all ways cool.\n\nNow to the important stuff; the food and beer. The beer was cold but not cold enough, I'd honestly have to say it was cool. You know a beer is cold when there's condensation on the bottle, a good example is when you bring out a glass of ice water and there is moisture on the outside of the glass, that means its cold on the inside. To say the least it was cool, tasted warmer then my water and therefore like crap. Any savvy beer drinker knows, especially those that prefer Sam Adams, that a good beer temperature is between 39 and 45 degrees; mine tasted more like in the low to mid 50's. Yuck, but I still drank it because I'm a man, and a man never wastes beer. I ordered another hoping for a better one, but I was disappointed again.\n\nThe burger was good, very slightly pink even though I asked for well done, and was served on a perfectly toasted bun with too much lettuce and two slices of tomato. With half the lettuce off, the burger tasted excellent; the fries were also good and had just enough seasoning unlike other places that pile on the salt.\n\nThe price for a burger and two beers was $18.32 with tax. That's $4.50 a beer and $7.95 for the burger. Not great but not bad for Vegas, I'd say it's the average around here. If you go there Mon-Fri between 11am-3pm you can get the burger for $5.95.", "stars": 3}

It took about 5 minutes or so for us to be acknowledged by a server, and I guess we weren't in her station because she took our drink orders, and another server brought them to us.  I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, and my boyfriend had the fish tacos.  My burrito was ok, but it was lukewarm at best, and the cheese inside was barely melted.  I didn't say anything because I figured they would just nuke it, and when I got it back it would be too hot to eat.  The chips and salsa were good, but it was a small serving, and they charge for them when most Mexican places just give them to you.  \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is really targeting the younger crowd, maybe college students and 20-somethings.  I don't think I saw a male server, but there was a male bartender.  The girls were all in cutoffs, really, really short cutoffs, and bikini tops.  It was chilly in there too, so not sure what they will do when the weather is colder.  There was also a guy that was blowing alcohol onto a flame in a bottle, making a big fire ball.  Very entertaining.....NOT! \n\n It is reasonably priced, and if I were still in college, it would probably be a great place to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night.

Oh how I wish I'd kept on walking.....\n\nFirst, this is not a Nepalese restaurant, it is definitely indian. I was lured in by the fact that they listed a number of goat curries on the menu and I do love me some goat. I haven't seen many restaurants in College Park with goat on the menu and since they had so many varieties I figured they must know what they are doing. I ordered the cucumber salad (3.99) and the goat thali (13.99). When I arrived the restaurant was somewhat empty, though there was one large table that was being served entrees and another very large group that was filing in. \n\nThe server brought water out immediately along with papadam + chutney, which was nice. They were diligent about refilling water in my experience. Also, my food was served pretty quickly. The cucumber salad was huge -- I mean giant, certainly not appropriately sized for a single person. \n\nThe food was ok, but not great. The flavor of the goat curry was ok, but the goat was not cooked long enough and was quite tough. You wouldn't be able to eat this curry with naan -- it needed a knife! Much of it was bones, which comes with the territory and would be fine if it were tender such that the bits of meat were capable of being removed from the bone. The goat thali came with daal (lacked flavor, good texture), and aloo gobi (meh) and a gigantic mound of rice. This was the largest thali I had ever seen in my life and I have eaten many a thali. It was honestly preposterous. Needless to say, there was no way I could finish.\n\nAnd then came the waiting. Things kind of picked up in the place and they are horribly understaffed. I waited no less than 30min before someone finally came to ask if I was done. There was a ton of food left and I assumed they would box it up, but instead, 10 or so minutes later they brought the check. I didn't bother to argue, because honestly, I just wanted to leave at that point. \n\nI think I've been spoiled by living in the California Bay Area for a long time before Toronto and I have found the flavor of the curries etc in Toronto to really lack depth.

{"text": "I stopped in here for the first time today after reading the reviews on here. I was looking for an inexpensive haircut that also was well done, which I know is a hard combination to find. It took me a while to find it, I thought it had closed down but when I found it it's a small place but the woman was friendly. She said she had an appointment in 10 minutes but took me anyway. The wash and condition was very quick, much quicker than I even do at home, then she sprayed a lot of detangler in my hair as it was long and my hair gets very tangled when wet and not conditioned enough, so I thank her for working through it. The haircut took about 25 minutes and she made me stand for some of the time, which I am not complaining about it's just I think that I had longer hair and she would have to bend to get the bottom straight, but she compared everything to make sure it was straight. She dried it quickly and with a round brush which I liked. The cost was 23 dollars (so cheap) especially since moving to Toronto I was used to pay upwards of 50. I gave her a good tip because her appointment waited about ten minutes because she took me as a walk in, and for the price her service was good. I bet that if I had booked the appointment, I would have had a better wash and style, but the cut is great and looks fantastic, I will book an appointment next time and I will be going back.", "stars": 3}

{"text": "The pros: Smart, clean atmosphere in a renovated firehouse. Excellent focaccia for a starter. Good drinks.\n\nCons: The service. Had it not been for the condescending server (and the atrocious dessert, sesame semifreddo, that resembled dried out halvah) Bar Marco would have received 3 stars. It began by the server telling our group of 4 that arrived at 6 PM that we had to be out by 7:30 b/c our table was reserved; the restaurant was half empty at 6 so we could have easily been seated at another table. (At 8 PM, when we walked back to our car after visiting the Strip District, Bar Marco had only a handful of customers. No one was at the table at which we had sat.) The server answered my question of \"Do you serve small plates, tapas?\" with \"we HATE the term 'tapas.' the chef calls them medium plates.\" Chastised, my friends and I ordered 5 medium plates. After placing our order, the server said we should have ordered 2 plates per person, information that would have been helpful when I first inquired about plate size. \n\nAs I don't eat meat, I asked if a sausage could be held or if it was already blended into the dish, a dish that I wouldn't have necessarily ordered but was put on the spot to order more food. No, every ingredient in the food was \"essential.\" Traditionally, if a restaurant doesn't allow ingredients to be withheld or substituted, this is stated on the menu. Likewise, if a chef recommends ordering more than 1 plate per person or if the plate size differs from the norm, the customers are told this up front. Not a huge deal but the patronizing way that the information was conveyed was. (Also, as an FYI, 5 shared dishes would be enough food for 4 people. We didn't come close to finishing what we'd ordered.) \n\nFast forward to 1 of the 3 dessert options, toffee pudding. Apparently it should have been labeled pear pudding b/d the server informed us that pear, the last ingredient listed, was, again, an \"essential ingredient\" prepared three ways so to withhold it would ruin the dessert. So, we had the $12 sesame semifreddo, which was so unappealing that each of us took just one sample bite and left the rest.  \n \nAs an aside, I grew around Pittsburgh and had always raved to my East Coast friends what a friendly, kind city it was. I visited Bar Marco with friends who had never been to the 'burgh and I was eager to show them how hip while nice Pittsburgh was. This was not the introduction that they received.", "stars": 2}

I got the 7 oz filet and my girlfriend got the Sheppards pie.  The filet was done correctly and favorful.  But the baked potatoe looked like it came from the childs menu, it wasn't much bigger than the steak.  It only only came with sour cream and butter with no other options offered.  My girlfriends Sheppards pie was favorful but seemed cheaply done.

{"text": "HAIR STYLIST AT PAR EXSALONCE CAN'T CUT A SIMPLE BOB EVEN WHEN SHOWN A PICTURE!\n\nFour months ago I went to Par Exsalonce and got a wonderful chin length bob from Keni.  He listened carefully to my special needs (I had just lost lots of hair from surgery pain and medication). I was so delighted with Keni's haircut !  I never imagined my 'sick' hair could look so good. Couple months later I called to schedule a trim with Keni and was told he was no longer there (it appears to be a revolving door at Par Exsalonce with stylists and staff) so, an appointment was reluctantly made with a stylist named Julie.\n\nI showed Julie my cell phone pictures of the bob Keni had given me and told her about my hair loss and showed her how it was finally beginning to grow in again.  Julie did not listen one bit about the bob I wanted, nor did she even attempt to replicate the chin length bob Keni had given me.\n\nShe haphazardly cut short layers everywhere into my hair making the pieces so short that they could not even be tucked behind my ears! The haircut she gave me left me looking like a mop head with different unmanageable lengths all over. I know this sounds unbelievable, but this is exactly what happened.\n\nNot only does Julie not care, she doesn't listen to a clients needs, is disrespectful of a clients needs and is clearly incredibly incompetent.\n\nShe gave me the worst hack job imaginable which will take 4-5 months to grow out. She has caused me so much pain, grief and sadness ... that no one deserves.\n\nDO NOT USE JULIE at PAR EXSALONCE ....... and take your chances with anyone else who cuts hair there.", "stars": 3}

There was an attendant standing next to my car and I tried to explain to him how I had never been to that type of car wash before, but in response he gave me a sympathetic look and said, \"I don't speak English.\" Damn. I got out and pointed at the vacuum and said, \"can I use that?\" He shook his head and pointed at himself. I was sad because I park under a huge tree at school and there was tree debris in my hood and trunk panels that I knew they wouldn't get. Then a man came up to me and asked what I wanted. I said, \"what's the cheapest wash you have?\" He said that the basic got me a wash and vacuum, and it was ten dollars. First off, that's kinda pricy for a girl who works the occasional babysitting job and is planning on paying for a prom dress in the near future, so I wanted to just get in my car and drive off, but that wasn't gonna happen. I said sure, and he told me to leave my keys in the car. \n\nI had no idea where to go. I just stood there like an idiot and watched as they cleaned my interior that still had my old receipts and water bottles in it because I wasn't planning on getting a full on car wash. Then a young guy came up to me and said I had a dent in my windshield that was \"bigger than usual\" and asked if I had seen it. Duh. It had been there since we bought the car four years ago. It was a sturdy crack. He then proceeded to ask if I had full coverage on the car. I had no idea what that meant, so of course, like an idiot, I said yes. He then asked me for my insurance card so he could call and tell them he was repairing my window. I then got light headed and fumbled for an excuse to not call my insurance because, I don't even know who my provider is. He understood, but by that time I was totally out of it and wishing I had gone to the sketchy self service car wash closer to my house. \n\nOnce I had had a little small talk with the guy he told me where to pay, and I sprinted to the little store tucked behind the wash and paid my ten dollars. Then I went out and watched as my car was put through the was and how the big dryers at the end sprayed a bunch of pollen from my trunk onto the wet bumper. Great. This was slighting cleaned off but not entirely, but at this point, I was ready to hop in my car and never look back. \n\nFinally they were finished and I was pretty satisfied with the interior.

I was kind of bummed as I was ready to get my part-tay on, but they had been drinking for a couple days already and were already  tired and worn out. I think this is why they hadn't figured out where they wanted to eat and go out on a Sat night, which you know you can't do in Vegas if you expect to go somewhere good. They also didn't really feel like searching out a place outside the Venetian, which is why we ended up here. I kind of had a let down feeling as soon as we walked in. It was only about half empty and really quiet - just not Vegas on a Saturday night. \n\nOur waiter was nice enough and I felt bad for him because this group was really set on not getting any fun cocktails, apps, desserts, so I give him a star for putting up with us. He was really trying - I hope he gets a job at a more popular place soon.\n\nBut other than him, everything was kind of lackluster. I ordered the special - salmon, which I thought was good. I also had a cosmo, which was right on point - thank you bartender (although the glass was not even half full). The prices were ok for what we had so no real complaints.\n\nHowever, I hate to say it, but both my friend (she also ate the salmon) and I had an upset stomach soon after eating. No one else in the party did, which makes me think something about the salmon was really off - I did notice that both of our pieces were very inconsistently cooked. Anyway, I still thought it tasted good but it definitely killed our night, as my friend was way more ill than me and she went back to her room. Yes, on a Saturday night, so you know this wasn't just feeling a little out of it. F me (and poor her!). But on a good note, I still had fun gambling for a bit before going to my room (the next morning was absolute hell on my stomach though). \n\nBottom line - go somewhere else if you want any resemblance of a fun Vegas vibe.

I knew that the ambiance was not going to be upscale, which is fine with me, but the food is not as exciting as the previous reviewers make it seem.  Maybe my taste buds are a little too snobby, but like I said I have had amazing soul food in other places, not just the South. \n\nMoving on, I had the fried chicken, mac n cheese, black eyed peas, cabbage, and corn bread.  I must say that the black eyed peas and corn bread were pretty good, but the cabbage lacked lots of flavor, and so did the fried chicken.  Also the fried chicken was very salty, but lacked flavor, which to me is a little oxymoronic. \n\nThe waitress/waiter were very nice.  I will not go back because I do not feel like the meal was worth the $13.00 plus tax.\n\nI will go over and try Lo-Los Chicken and Waffles soon and hopefully there, I will find delicious soul food that I left behind on the East Coast in New Jersey, NY, and Philly!", "stars": 3}

So, we headed to the bar and were greeted by this rough and rather abrasive female bartender.  I felt as if I was in a ghetto hole in the wall at the bar, because her customer service skills were a negative 10.  Even at the hole in the walls on the East Coast where I am from, the bartenders were much nicer and attentive.  I may not be back just because of her.  Oh and they give you your two for one at the same time, instead of letting you sip on one and then come back for your other one later, like other bars, or restaurants do.  I do not like that system!!\n\nLastly, once again, the soul food out here is not very appealing and I think that I should just discontinue with trying to find it here in the Arizona area and just go back and visit friends in Los Angeles or family on the East Coast when I need an amazing soul food fix.\n\nI had the cat fish nuggets, which were pretty tasty but nothing to write home about.\nI also had the mac-n-cheese which seemed to lack cheese, warmth (it was luke warm when it came out), and flavor.

He and I were really excited thinking that their happy hour would end at least by 6 pm like most places, but it ends Very early at 5 pm. That is something that does not make sense to me especially since most people's work days do not end until 5 pm. \n\nMoving on...\n\nWe were seated on the patio, which at first was awesome and beautiful and comfortable since they had the misters on. Then as the sun started to disappear, the mosquitos started to appear. I was badly eaten up around my ankles and on the top of my feet by the mosquitos on the patio. My guy friend had to request that they bring over one of the citronella candles; that helped a little but it was already too late.\n\nNow the food...\n\nThe beers that they have on tap were delicious and I truly enjoyed them. I had the Windsor Style Backyard burger without the bun, wrapped in lettuce. It was perfectly prepared and the toppings complimented the flavor of the burger. I had their Mac-Cheese as a side and was pleasantly surprised. When I think of Mac-n-Cheese, I think of only getting this dish as soul food restaurants normally when I am back East or down south, but they actually did a very good job with the flavors. :)\n\nMy friend ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, which on the other hand was not as culinary pleasing as my dish. The salad lacked flavor, dressing, and excitement. The Ahi tuna was prepared very well, but the salad portion lacked on various levels. He told one of the servers about his lack of culinary orgasms with the salad and the manager Lisa came out and talked to us and also removed it from our bill. We were not expecting that, but it was a pleasant surprise and I appreciate a customer service driven and involved establishment. Lisa was adorable, professional, and a great listener. \n\nWith that, I will be back. I am overall impressed with their establishment and the service.

The caramelized onions were overpowered by the tomato and cilantro, the green chili creme and avocado salsa were missing their sex appeal/flavor/spice.  The 9-grain bread was yummy, and the fruit was decent.  The potatoes were the best thing on my plate.\n\nAlso, my friend wanted to have their \"Best Crabcakes in Phoenix\" as a part of his meal, but they would not do it.  They only have the crab cakes as a sandwich and nothing else.  He really wanted to have a crab cake omelette, which sounded like a great idea, but in order to do so, they would have to \"add\" the crab cake to the bill, for an additional $9.00.  Give me a break!! Coming from the East Coast where I enjoyed many seafood delicacies at the NJ/NY/MD shores, I am sure that their crab cakes are not even worth an additional $9.00.\n\nI digress!!\n\nOverall, everything was pleasant.

I did not try the food, because I was heading out later in Scottsdale for some food and drinks with friends, but it did look good.\n\nAfter she finished her shift, several attentive male bartenders then took care of my new guy friends and I, and thus, my night ended on a positive note.", "stars": 3}

Well, as a foodie that loves to cook and explore in the kitchen, I was underwhelmed by the tasteless dough that they use for their flatbread pizzas. I have made better pizza at home than this place. I have never had such lackluster pizza in my life; I ordered the vegetarian pizza, which they claim has garlic, spinach, onion, tomatoes, etc without the \"special topping.\" I requested that the \"special topping\" be placed on the side. The pizza came out and I asked the bartender, where is the garlic, she said that the garlic is only found in the \"special topping.\" The \"special topping\" consist of garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. How tacky and unappealing. Where are the real pieces of garlic? Also the other veggies present were scarce and lacked in flavor as well.\n\nI needed to wash down the nasty pizza and ordered a pumpkin pie vodka drink and that was yummy. But, no one could go wrong with this since it only consisted of pumpkin pie vodka, ice, and seltzer water.\n\nThe live jazz band made the experience tolerable but I will never good back.

For $10 more the prix fixe included an appetizer and dessert. My husband chose a steak and started his meal with a Caesar's salad. We also ordered a half dozen oysters to start off our meal. The oysters were absolutely awful--some of the worst I've ever had. When the waiter asked if we preferred large or small oysters, we responded with large. Either he forgot to bring the right type of oysters or he forgot the magnifying glass because these bad boys were not only minuscule but they were completely tasteless.

I assumed the prix fixe items would be spectacular, considering the chef specifically chooses these items for the menu and probably makes these items most often due to the price. I was dead wrong. The pumpkin soup was ok, but the consistency was off. The soup actually had a pool of oil that separated and rested on top. Totally unappetizing. The skate was ok, but again, nothing to write home about. The dessert of hazelnut fondant and coffee ice cream was absolutely disgusting. I hate to be so blunt, but seriously, how do you screw up dessert? I have a huge sweet tooth; Cover anything in chocolate and I will usually eat it AND enjoy it. This dessert was so bad I took one bite and left it on the plate. My husband's steak was ok, but it didn't hold a candle to the steaks he's had at the other Vegas restaurants we've been to (Nine, Mon Ami Gabi, Rosemary's, Prime, heck even Ruth's Chris). For the price, I should have taken him next door to SW Steakhouse. No Michelin Star, but everyone we talked to who had been to both restaurants prefer SW over DB. Shoulda, woulda, coulda, right? \n\nEven the atmosphere stunk. There are very few tables available. All of the unlucky diners who are not fortunate enough to receive a table are piled in to the middle of the restaurant like sardines, with one side of the table against a bench seat and the other facing away from the show. Despite the fact that I made reservations 3 weeks in advance and put in a special request for a table with a view, my request was not honored. I don't fault the restaurant for this since I realize it's just a request, not a guarantee, but others who are hoping to have a romantic meal should definitely be aware of the poor seating situation. \n\nDon't eat here or you will be sorry. That is especially true for you yelpers who frequent the finer restaurants in Vegas. I promise you, if you like good food and you go here, you will be disappointed.", "stars": 2}

{"text": "Skyline lofts is a great building with some cool features; however, the management of the complex is unprofessional in their business tactics.  I greatly enjoyed the complex under Mark Taylor, but as soon as Weidner Properties took over the building, the professionalism of Mark Taylor went out the door.  It took days to get items fixed while living there; however, it took them no time to do an invasive walk through the week before we moved from the complex.  In the walk through, the managing director told us that the paint was not the special order paint they use to paint and therefore they would be charging us to repaint the moonlight white with the \"Weidner\" moonlight white color.  They offered to sell us the paint and we could paint it to cut costs, which I jumped at.  For a second time in a week I repainted the rooms and hall to their specifications with three coats only to then again be charged an additional $200 at move out for painting.  In addition, the complex will charge you tax, administration fees, and cleaning costs that are more expensive than the professional maid services we have always used.  These charges are present no matter how much you leave the property in good condition.   To prevent you from contesting the charges, they give you 10 days to pay the charges or they send it to collections, even though the mailed letter with the charges took 4 to 5 business days to reach me through standard mail.  The short payment time is unprofessionally done purposely to prevent you from contesting these fees.  In other words, your money will not go far will living here with the service you get, but complex management will do everything they can to nickel and dime you when they get the chance.  \n\nWith the recent expansion, growth, and other options in downtown Phoenix, I seriously recommend looking at other complexes until Weidner reevaluates how they run their properties.

However, the entire meal was ruined by our awful server.\nWe waited 30 minutes past our reservation time, which I can accept for such a busy place, but it would have been nice if there had been any acknowledgement of the wait at all. Especially considering it was 6:15 and I had made reservations 2 months in advance. Instead, I watched as the hostesses twirled their hair and looked bored. My bestie and I looked past this though as I had been previously in August and had a fun and delicious meal.\nOnce we finally got seated our waiter came to greet us. He was very friendly, telling us all about the menu and the wine. This demeanor changed immediately upon learning we were not drinking alcohol. I couldn't drink and my friend did not want to drink without me. I was however still very prepared to eat a ton and indulge! \nWe no longer had this urge after receiving just our drinks. I ordered an ice tea which my mother ordered upon my visit previously. The presentation then was so beautiful and I was looking forward to it again, something I mentioned to our waiter. A few minutes later he returned with a diet coke and my tea. I know tea, I drink tea with breakfast lunch and dinner, and this was not good tea. It was bitter and over brewed and tasted like it had been sitting out for quite awhile. I let our waiter politely know, this seemed to annoy him further, and waited. Upon his return he carried the full presentation I had been expecting the first time! He then tells me without any hint of apology, \"He didn't know where the tea bags were so he just gave you what the cooks were drinking.\" Then he just walked away! He didn't present the tea the way the other waiter had and he acted like getting served what the cooks were drinking was acceptable for 6 dollars! \nWe proceeded to order the dates with sausage and marscapone and parmesan and honey for appetizers. These were both ok but I don't think we enjoyed them much wondering what type of kitchen they came out of. We each ordered just a pasta because our appetites were quickly being ruined by the continued attitude from our waiter. These were both very good, the bucatini and the tortellini were fresh and perfectly al dente. \nOnce finished with our pastas I was still hoping to salvage the meal with my favorite part of my previous experience: the dessert cart. However, in an attempt to get us to spend more (which we would have had our waiter not been a jerk) we were handed the dessert menu instead. Each dessert was twice the price ($12-$14) as on the dessert tray ($6) plus we didn't get the fun of seeing all the beautiful desserts! We decided not to order anything due to overall disappointment with the experience. Once we said no to dessert our waiter did not utter a single word to us. I could not believe how rude and unprofessional he was. I guess he didn't think we had spent enough to care about our tip, so that at least saved me some money.\nSuch high hopes, and I won't be back.

{"text": "I'd heard great things about this place, so I decided to try it on my own.  It was close to 11 PM when I went in, and I had the Hong Kong style crispy chow mein with shrimp and bok choy with some carrots in a white sauce.  I specifically asked it be cooked in a white sauce, as they will usually serve you a brown sauce unless specified.  I also had their pan fried potstickers.  I tell you, the chow mein was perfect for me, because they used the really thin noodles and fried it up.  With the sauce and the tender shrimp, it reminded me of some of the hole-in-the-wall Chinese eateries in San Francisco.  The potstickers were decent, too.  I had a very positive first experience here.\n\nNow, the second time, I brought my family, and we had their family style combinations.  The Diamond beef was tasty, and we gave it a thumbs up.  We also ordered their sweet and sour pork, and I didn't like it at all.  The pork was difficult to chew, and I felt like I was chewing on the lowest cut of pork there was, as it seemed to be cartilagenous in some bites.  The sweet and sour sauce was OK, but it didn't mask anything when it came to the pork.  We also ordered the pan fried potstickers since they were so tasty during my first visit.  They came out, and they just didn't taste the same...like they were lacking in seasoning.\n\nAlso, too, the family combination meal comes with your choice of soup and we had the egg flower, and we had no complaints there.  They also had some appetizers--fried wonton and fried, battered shrimp.  The shrimp had a little smell to it as I bit into it, and upon mastication, I noticed it was starting to go rancid.  \n\nHow disappointing my second visit was from my first.

{"text": "First of all, I love F&E, but I'm writing this today with three stars because of the recent changes that have taken place.  They've gotten rid of the clearance section for groceries and have integrated the clearance items within their designated areas.  So, this means that both clearance and regular items are on the same shelves, and you're only made aware of the discounted items by a yellow sign.  However, you've got to dig for them, pushing the regular priced items around and making a mess.  Plus, there is no indication when the clearance items are all gone, and sometimes, you'll push around items to look for the discounted items, and they're no longer there.  I was informed by a staff worker that the discounted items will only receive one markdown, as opposed to three markdowns should the item/s not sell by day's end.  Their ground beef has gone up as well as the nuts they sell.  In fact, a lot of items have gone up.  I haven't seen a F&E coupon in their circulars going on a couple of weeks now, too.  They've got great quality products, and I'm not taking that away from them, but more waste will result by getting rid of the section with clearance items.  Sometimes, you discover an item by accident on clearance and wish to try it, and I certainly don't have the time to rummage through each section on a shelf looking for clearance items that may or may not be there.\n\nThis particular store has recently changed their hours and have gone to being open 24 hours.  I'm not sure if that decision has had a trickling effect on the increase in prices.  I know this:  I will be shopping there less frequently, and that does really sadden me, because while I value the quality items they put out, at the end of the day, my pocketbook dictates my grocery store loyalty.", "stars": 3}

I'll admit that I won't go throught he drive-thru anymore, because on the two sole occasions doing so--mind you, this is when they first opened, it took about 30 minutes to get my food.  That being said, I have ordered at the counter and have eaten in-house, and the time to get my food wasn't all that long.  The burgers, themselves, are of good size and quality.  While fries are not healthy, they give you a lot of them for your money.  I enjoy their 1/3 pound cheeseburger, their avocado burger, and pastrami burger.  These are not sandwiches for the faint-hearted, because they are all very filling.  For the money, you get a lot.  It is a mom and pop place, and as such, service at the counter can vary.  I'd like to believe that they are doing their best, but the young crew needs a few lessons in public relations.  The place is clean, but there is a pervasive smell of, to me, \"sewage,\" somewhere.

Firstly, I had an appointment on October 10 with a particular nail person, and I called to confirm that he was there, and guess what? He was off that day. Secondly, I've had the same type of pedicure done since they opened, and all of a sudden, during my last pedicure appointment, my pedicure price went up $5 dollars.  What's up with that?  Now, I don't want to go back to them, because no one can actually justify the price increase.  I'm just not there normal clientele, I guess, where I do not opt for any nail polish/coloring on my nails.  I just like them buffed and polished, which doesn't take any time at all.

And it's very convenient, situated between where I work and the assisted living residence where my father lives. \n\nI had one fun experience with 20 or so people in a big party. Our food took forever but no one even noticed because it was so much fun. It was only as we were leaving, remarking to each other about how long we'd been there. \n\nMy second experience was with my wife, and it was bad. There were kids yelling and screaming in the courtyard. We asked very politely if there was anything they could do, and we felt the response from our server was dismissive and rude. (As parents of four boys 13, 6, 6 and 4, we're pretty tolerant, but we were on date night, trying to enjoy some peace.) The food was passable, but not what we remembered from the night of the party.\n\nI took my father there a few months later, because I often go to Lucy's for breakfast and it's right by his home. I asked the server to surprise me with a signature dish and I gave her some parameters about what I like and was in the mood for (something hearty and savory). She brought me french dip which was blah. The bread seemed like cheap white processed bread, the meat did not taste bad, but it was room temp and not particularly tasty. I asked for a second cup of dip heated up really hot. That helped a bit. My dad hardly tasted his salmon, but didn't say anything. I only noticed when we were ready to leave and I asked to try it. It tasted fishy -- not fresh. Our server was very happy and nice, but a bit over-tasked. Perhaps they had more people than they expected for a summer evening mid-week.\n\nIt's a shame because it is so quaint and the setting is outstanding -- and it's in my 'hood. \n\nThe reason I will come back is their response. I am starting to write reviews, but it's not my habit. However, I received a \"semi-spam\" automated invitation to something, and responded just on a whim, expecting it to end up in an unattended mailbox. Instead I got a very nice response. \n\nI don't expect things will turn around on a dime, but I will be back.

They could probably expand their martini menu a bit, but their beer and wine selection seemed extensive.\n\nAppetizer:  Calamari.  I really enjoyed this.  It had some type of thai sauce on it, and it was truly delicious.  \n\nEntree:  My boyfriend had the chicken.  Huge portion, he said it was good.  Now, here is where my disappointment sunk in.  I ordered the scallops.  I am not a cheap person by any means, but when you are paying over $20 for scallops, there best be MORE THAN 3 on the freaking plate!  I can get good scallops for about the same price at Pier W, and they give you 5!!!  It was served with risotto, and I did like that.  The scallops themselves were good, but overloaded with salt!  Now, I like salt, I enjoy it, even though I know how bad it is for me.  I had 3 glasses of water before bed because of all the salt.  (Maybe it's better there were only 3 scallops on the plate, for that reason alone).\n\nDessert:  Since my significant other doesn't like chocolate (!!!), I always try to order something we can share, so I went with the Pineapple Upside Down cake.  It was....ok.  Just ok.  \n\nI don't think one bad entree will deter me from going there again, as I could try other entrees on the menu, and try a different dessert as well.

{"text": "I lived at Strawberry Hills for 2 years in a 1 bedroom 1.5 bath unit.\nThe pros: There is no comparison in rent price for this large sized apartment in this location of town. Rent only goes up about $25 per lease, which is reasonable if compared to other management companies. Maintenance is very prompt - call office if urgent matter is not resolved in 24hrs and it will get fixed. They have monthly events for all the residents if that's something you like. Walking distance to Fresh Market, Rite Aid and a number of restaurants. Staff is communicative and forthright about safety concerns that occur on the property.\nThe cons: OLD apartments even though they are moderately clean looking and functioning. That means all the doors and windows leak air (electric bill), there are sometimes mold issues on the ceiling in the living room (gets painted over by maintenance), there is that \"old\" smell to the kitchen cabinets and closets (easily covered up by products), poor insulation between upstairs/downstairs units (neighbors can smell what you are cooking despite using exhaust fan and can hear EVERYTHING you are doing above normal conversation level) and they have to work on the water pipes at least 3 times a year (your water gets shut off so they can perform temporary fixes; gets more annoying than you might think). If you have a crazy/disruptive neighbor there is nothing the office can do, you just have to constantly call the police until this causes the neighbor to be evicted - honestly it's just easier to move at that point.\nWarning: If you have health issues or have moderate to severe environmental allergies, do NOT move here. They will become exponentially worse.\nIf you can't tell by the above, my primary reason for moving was my disruptive upstairs neighbor (if I told you all the things she did you wouldn't believe me, but I could not live a normal life). My secondary motive for moving was my allergies, which became gradually so bad that my health started being affected.\n Since I have moved 5 months ago to a farther, but newer apartment complex, I have normal neighbors and my allergies have returned to mild (it is fully Spring right now) and all negative heath affects have disappeared. \nAll things considered, I would recommend this complex if you do not have allergies and are not too concerned with up to date finishes.", "stars": 2}

The chef who had seen us sitting there like two big barneys on his way to and from his break saved the night. He politely re-took our order, gave us a fifteen minute wait time, then proceeded to hook us up Thank You Bob. Our burgers and onion rings were superb and The Chef gave us an order of shrimp with french fries *on the house*. All the food was delicious (we ate in our room).\nWhats hilarious is the fact the waitress finally came back with a check in her hand and plopped it down on the counter. Succubus. But I digress. I tipped The Chef for all his kindness and this little experience didn't deter my Roxy's adventures that happened the next day *wink, wink*. We'll leave that one for next time.\n\nWhat you can take away from this overdue review: be patient, very patient. You'll never know who will come save the day. Also, screw that waitress.", "stars": 3}

{"text": "Stopped in on Saturday for lunch. Place was dead, only one other couple in the restaurant. Noticed speakers on the wall, but no music was playing. Not exactly a jovial atmosphere for a wonderful spring day in March. I ordered the Carne Asada and a Cochinita Pibil to be washed down with an Horchata. I then proceeded to the Salsa bar which appeared to have an outstanding selection and I immediately started filling cups with the many varietals eagerly anticipating being able to dress up my tacos. Chips were then brought out to snack on while I waited for my food. I can only describe these as cold, flavorless, and typical of most chain restaurant chips. Not a good sign. My Taco's arrived shortly thereafter. Unfortunately these too were nothing to write home about. The tortillas were cold and appeared store bought. The carne asada was overcooked and lacked any form of flavor. I attempted to spice things up by adding salsas, but these too were flavorless. Very little spice and hardly any seasoning. The cochinita pibil was enjoyable, as it was juicy and tasted like a quality cut of pork, but wrapped inside of a cold store bought tortilla the experience was muted. \n\nI highly doubt I will be returning to this restaurant, and I honestly question those that have written such outstanding reviews. My opinion, no taco shop should bill itself as \"Gourmet\" if it does not make its own tortillas, has bland salsas, and cannot make a juicy and flavorful carne asada.", "stars": 2}

Hot Salsa had a smokey with moderately spicy flavoring, blended well with the steak. Order was prepared quickly. \n\nThe Bad: Portion was small. Guacamole was all but invisible. Not much beyond the flavoring of the meat, i.e. salsa picante was bland needs a kick from more jalapeno.  Lemonade was good but not worth $2.50 with no refills. Chips were terrible. When are restaurants going to realize that ordering multi-colored tortilla chips from Sysco is not a good idea? I guess that's why they give you a tiny bag filled with only five chips. \n\nOverall: I like big burritos with lots of everything, lots of meat, lots of salsa, and lots of guacamole.

First off it was extremely busy which is a good sign that a place is good. I had called my order ahead and came to pick it up. It was ready pretty quickly - we got a bean and cheese tostada, a bean and cheese gordita, 2 carne asada tacos, a chicken quesadilla, a bag of chips and salsa and a carne asada burrito. When I opened up the bag and took of the foil the food did not look very good. Some of the food was kind of unrecognizable that I actually went it and had them double check my order. The two tacos kind of seemed that they were thrown together and one was on top of the other but my son said that he liked them. The burrito was a good size burrito and my daughter said it was ok. My other two kids split a chicken quesadilla and they both ate the whole thing. The tostada and the gordita were small - about the size of a corn tortilla and really smashed. When I pulled off the foil most of the cheese and some of the beans came off. The gordita tasted fried, which I had asked for it grilled, maybe frying is part of it being a gordita but there was not much difference in what it looked like. Also after taking my first bite into the gordita I found a hair. Nothing to turn you off from food faster is finding a hair in your food. I ripped off the part that had the hair in it and threw it away before my kids saw it because as a mom I know that if they had seen the hair they would have refused to eat their food and honestly I did not want to waste $27 in food. The tostada was pretty good which I shared with my baby. Even though there is many good reviews for this place I most likely won't be coming back after my experience.", "stars": 2}

Unfortunately after my visit last night, my excitement was short lived.\n\nI agree with many other reviewers about the service at the restaurant. It's not the best, but you can tell the bartenders and wait staff are trying hard. When we were attended to the staff was very helpful and willing to go out of their way to assist with our beer and food choices.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is very nice with exposed brick and a beautiful outdoor patio.  It's a nice place to hang out and have a few drinks.  One if not the only place in Fort Mill with true outdoor dining that's not on a sidewalk.\n\nHobo's also has an impressive draft beer list that any craft beer connoisseur would be pleased with.  It includes a vast local selection as well as some national and macro brewers.  The price points aren't too bad either.\n\nOn to the food.  I was very disappointed with my entr\u00e9e.  The burger I ordered (The Mack and Mack) was undercooked on the inside and burnt on the outside.  It tasted like a mediocre grilled burger at a cookout. The slaw tasted like it was right out of the container.  My wife's burger was about the same.  I found it funny that her burger, The Big Apple, was served on Sourdough bread that was cut as thin as Wonder Bread.\n\nAll in all this place has potential to be great if they improve their food.  I would probably go back for a drink on the patio but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there again.\n\nCharlotte and its outlying areas have a great burger scene.

The staff was always young but friendly and nice.\n\nToday I went and ordered my regular.  I immediatly noticed that it was about $3 more than in the past.  I balked and the black girl behind the counter said that they had raised all their prices apologetically.  I commented that the side of meat must be a huge portion for that price.\nThe food came and it was LESS meat than I have ever received before.  The side of meat was pretty much the same as the Gyro.  The girl apologised and offered to make me some more.  I said that would be fine.  A minute later this young white girl came over to ask what the problem was.  She said that was the amount of meat that was served and I could get a refund if I wanted.  I told her I used to come here a lot and the portion had gone down but the price went up.  Her response was that she had worked there for 7 years and it was always the same amount.  I again commented that I am a regular ( never seen her before) and that this is not what I usually got.  She told me she is the general manager of several locations and quoted what she probably learned in fast food supervisor training in a tone of voice that you get out of an exasperated teenager that thinks they know best.\nAt this point out of principle I said I would take the refund.  I hope they did not reuse the meat!\n\nEven though their food is decent it is now priced on par with a restaurant.  If I wanted snotty teenaged managers I would just go to McDonalds.

If it had fit in my purse it would have been sooo gone! :-) J/k ....sort of.\nI digress. I had a Soup, I think it was Tom Kha vegetarian.  I asked for the spiciest they have.  It was really good except for one root type thing that was un-chewable like a branch.  My friend said her soup was great too.\nAt this point I was already super full but then the vegetarian curry came.  It looked great but it was so hot that it was pretty much inedible.

This was \"mouth on fire then sneezing fits after\" hot.\nI reallize this review is not glowing but the funny thing is I really enjoyed it and can't wait to go back.

I kid you not, I have been there on separate occasions, and they've been out of basmati rice, chicken tikka masala, to go cups for soft drinks and even naan!!!! They are open until 10pm most days, and they may be out of these things at like 6pm or 7pm...not even the end of the night. Sometimes their staff, who are always nice, look really embarrassed to tell you they're out of things...like they have to do it a lot. \n\nSo it's very hit or miss. When it's good it's really good, but it's a bummer when you go in expecting to get things you like and you never know if you can count on them being there.  This place has such potential.

{"text": "Just finished dinner at this Morton's location and unfortunately I can't say it was too much better than my most recent Morton's experience in New York. \nAside from the bread and desserts, everything was just okay. If this were Outback or another lower-end steakhouse it would be passable, but for a steakhouse of this caliber and price point I was definitely disappointed. \nAt Morton's in new york a few months ago my french onion soup arrived after my steak so I never ended up tasting it. I was sooo looking forward to finally having the fench onion tonight and was severely disappointed. Instead of the rich, beefy broth of a great french onion soup I tasted a heavy rosemary flavor. It completely overpowered the soup to the point that I didn't even eat much of it which says a lot (take a look at some of my other reviews, I LOVE  a good french onion soup!). The salads we ordered (caesar and tomato/onion) were okay, but again nothing special. \n\nI'd be able to overlook a sub-par french onion soup at a steakhouse if the main attraction-the steak- is exceptional. For four people we ordered the double cut bone-in ribeye and a double cut filet. The ribeye was MUCH smaller than the one shown to us on the presentation menu (and that's accounting for shrinkage during cooking even though we order our steaks rare). The worst part of the meal was when we cut into the filet \"their leanest, most tender cut\" as decribed by the waiter, only to find large areas of fat and cartilage. It took us a few minutes and asking another server to send over our waiter before the issue could be rectified. As someone who has eaten in MANY steakhouses I found the service to be lacking, just as it had been in new york.\nFor dessert we ordered the key lime pie, cheesecake and creme brulee. The key lime pie and cheesecake were fantastic, but the creme brulee was a little to runny and the sugar crust a little too burnt. \nI think it will be quite a few years before I give Morton's another shot...there are way too many great steakhouses, both local and chains, to waste money on subpar steaks and service.", "stars": 3}

{"text": "For 25 years since I've lived in Las Vegas I always went to Siena Deli on Trop & Eastern for the \"Best Fresh Hot Italian Sausage\" and finally I get the chance to get over to the fancy new location on West Sahara to get out fix.  The Siena deli is now by far much more organized, lavished and beautiful.  However, their sausage is now a whopping $7 bucks a pound (it use to be $4-5 per pound)........but no biggie, everything has gone up.  I was so excited to taste it, so I get home, my hubby makes his sauce opens up the bag to add the sausage and first thing I notice is the sausage has no color (hot is usually red from the pepper and spice) and just by the look we can tell it is not the same quality and not to our surprise the flavor is not the same either.  The new product is mediocre, boring, and basically tasteless....total bummer and a big disappointment.  If you step it up & spice it up, we may be back but for 7 bucks a pound it better be made with kurobuta pork.  Too bad, it is so sad to see that another good ole Vegas establishment gone bad.  Adios to the good ole Siena that once was:(", "stars": 2}

The last time was for the dinner service.  For dinner, my boyfriend and I ordered the Goat Cheese Deviled Eggs, the Pepper-Crusted Ahi Tuna, and the Mussels with a tomato fennel broth.  We kept the menu because we wanted to order an entree as well, but we hadn't decided yet. Our appetizers came out and after trying them, we were not excited or interested in ordering more.  \nThe Deviled Eggs were fine, couldn't taste the goat cheese, but I could have made the same at home, and for $3 an egg, I should have.  \nThe Mussels were absolutely terrible.  The tomato-fennel broth was bland and had a terrible, mushy texture.  Half the mussel shells were missing the mussels, and they were not fresh.\nLastly, the Ahi Tuna. Noticeably frozen tuna. Bland. The pepper crust was so overwhelming and with a delicate fish like tuna, RAW tuna, it was just bad. The chef should know better.\nI read reviews about the awesome beer list here.... Any of the beers can be found cheaper elsewhere.\nWon't be back. Don't waste your money.", "stars": 2}

We were supposed to be eating Brunch, but the person who accepted the booking didn't inform the lady who made the booking that there would be no brunch because of Winterlicious, despite being asked to confirm that a brunch menu would be available.\n\nLuckily, their Winterlicious menu looked good. I ordered the Beet Salad, the Grilled Salmon & the Banana Cake.\n\nThe Beet salad was very good & the seasoning was perfect.\n\nThe Grilled salmon was nice, but there was very little sauce and a lot of lentils, which made it an average dish. (I tried the beef that my partner had ordered and it was pretty good.)\n\nThe Banana cake with Toffee sauce was ok. It was too sweet and rich for my liking.\n\nThe portions were good & overall the food was a 3.5 stars.\n\nThe reason I am giving it 2 stars is that the service wasn't great. It took the staff about 20 minutes to take our order. We were the first people in the restaurant and were a large group. At the time we were seated there was nobody else in there.\n\nI had to leave early for a play and so went to our server and asked her to give me a bill for my portion. She told me it wasn't easy to get my bill because it was a group and that's how the software worked and that it would take her a couple of minutes to print it out. Nearly 10 minutes later, I was still standing there, waiting for her to get my bill while she passed by me several times and went to other tables.\n\nI realise that the place was busy, but 10 minutes to get the bill for someone who has told them that they have to catch a play, is just ridiculous. There was also no apology and finally someone from our group volunteered to pay my bill and asked me to pay her back later. \n\nI will definitely avoid Bodega.

{"text": "I was lucky enough to go to the Santa Monica Border Grill back in 1995 while I was visiting some friends in L.A., and was blown away by it. I was at a conference in Las Vegas this last week, and I was happy to see that there was an outpost of the Border Grill there as well - of course I had to try it.\n\nI went during lunch one day, and had the guac to start, followed by the chicken chilaquiles. Whenever I am in Mexico, I try to eat chilaquiles for breakfast, so I was pleased to see them on the menu (even though it was lunch time). The chips were cooked well, but were RIDICULOUSLY salty. I though that maybe I had just received a bottom of the basket set (or something like that), so I asked for some new ones, but those were amazingly salty as well. Once I dusted a large amount of salt off the chips, though, they were good, as was the guacamole. The flavors were nicely blended, and they didn't skimp on the onion.\n\nThe chilaquiles were a disappointment, though. They were the \"green\" version (as opposed to red or, more rarely, mole chilaquiles), and the green salsa was very acidic. I like the flavor of tomatillos, but these almost tasted underripe, which made for a weird flavor mix with the queso fresco and the corn tortillas. The chicken in the dish came in big chunks of dry white meat, and didn't taste like it had been cooked with the rest of the chilaquiles ingredients at all.  It was very disappointing. For comparison, I was comped a free breakfast buffet at the Wynn, where they had what they called chilaquiles with eggs (really, it was more like a chilaquiles/migas hybrid) - the flavor profile of that dish was much more authentic than what I had at Border Grill. I know that people think highly of the Wynn buffet, but still, when the food at a restaurant that prides itself on authenticity is beaten by a buffet offering, that's a bad sign.\n\nI'll hang on to my good memories of the Border Grill in Santa Monica, but I won't be going back to the Vegas one again.", "stars": 3}

The Smokey Joe turkey sandwich was solid as well, boasting thick slices of crisp bacon. The high light was definitely the Tortilla Chicken soup.

And aside from a pair of college students dining with their parents, we were the only people there not collecting social security.\n\nSat on the beautifully appointed three-tiered patio which is great for people watching if you don't mind the Old Town trolley that drove by every 15 minutes. \n\nThe wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable if not a bit too casual. When I'm at a restaurant with this price point, I realize I'm paying as much for the experience as the food. A little more professionalism wouldn't hurt.\n\nWe started with the Foie Gras, waitaminute, no we didn't, because they were out. Did I mention the place wasn't even half full? That's a whole bunch of geriatric foie gras ordering SOB's. So we settled on the Himalayan Salt Block. Holy gimmicks, Batman. Tepid hamachi on a brick of pink salt. The aioli and the foam made from the grapefruit-like Japanese Yuzu were delicious but not enough to make up for the warm fish. Salads were next. You know you've got issues when the salad course is the highlight of the meal. Excellent Mach\u00e9 with a blood orange vinaigrette (with slices of said orange) accompanied by chevre rolled in smokey paprika. Simply awesome. The Baby Herb salad with walnuts and muscat vinaigrette was top notch as well. Our entre\u00e9s consisted of the Grilled Baby Lamb and the Mediterranean Sea Bass. Both had the potential to be excellent. Neither were. The lamb was bland and barely saved by the hazelnut/pinot noir reduction. The bass was good but not really impressive. Thin portions that were just kinda... there. \n\nNow, I've got to admit I was pleased with the sommelier and his suggested pairings. And our chocolate raspberry torte was a fantastic dessert. But despite the beautiful surroundings and a few tasty dishes, I still left with diner's remorse.\n\nI do have to recommend their upstairs bar, Upstairs. Clever, I know. But fantastic ambiance, cocktails and music each time I've been there. And they offer an abbreviated menu from downstairs if you're hungry. So while I might not be having dinner at The Estate House any time soon, I'd have a drink and\ndessert Upstairs any time.", "stars": 2}

Chipotle has a line inside, and a mob of people standing outside. I go up to the door to pull it open --- Locked. Are you kidding me? You are sitting on the most desirable piece of real estate for a business in the whole US tonight, with literal mobs banging on the door to give you money, so you shut it down and go home?", "stars": 2}

I was expecting some sort of oyster happy hour like many places (in here and other cities) commonly do, but every oyster in the place was $3-4 which is extremely high for Pittsburgh and higher than many reputable places I've visited elsewhere. \n\nWe ended up getting soup and sandwiches. The $15 bread bowl barely held more than a cups worth of soup. The clam chowder was decent but was extremely heavy on the bacon which had the shape and consistency of spam. This was not on the menu and the server didn't know the differences among the chowder options. \n\nThe service was the biggest letdown. Slow and inattentive, many employees just standing around when they could have been bussing tables or running food/drinks, and it took eons for the bill to be split and arrive.

{"text": "Only reason for 3 stars is the price. Way too expensive compared to other buffets. Wynn & Carnival buffet is cheaper and also has seafood selection such as crab legs. The first time I ate there, it was amazing, king crab legs & decent size lobster. But this was three years ago, it's changed since that first experience. Another time we went to Vegas, my main objective was to go back to this buffet, but was a little disappointed. It was still good, crab legs delicious, but the lobster shrunk & the other variety of food was just okay. Just recently went back again 2 weeks ago and after eating felt it was just way too much money for the quality. Crab legs were delicious again but the line just to get to them was ridiculous. They should have two separate lines offering crab legs to minimize the long wait. Also, the lobster they offer is mixed with what looks like a bunch of leftovers from shrimp pieces & was not great. Rest of the selection was good but not great. For $45 a person, I expected better quality & seafood galore, but it just doesn't seem they are living up to the title of 'seafood buffet.' On my way to Vegas again and this time I'll explore other buffets that offer seafood at a better price.", "stars": 3}

Just FYI I usually order sushi not rolls because rolls just fills you up and I order alottt at once because I don't like food pauses. I don't like it when there is a pause for my sushi to come out because you can slowly feel full. This is where everything went wrong. The fish was not fresh and the amount of rice they put with the raw fish is freakin ridiculous. You can't even taste the fish because there's so much rice. After 4 or 5 sushi, there was a 10minute pause. And also the server got mixed up with our order so she gave it to the table next next to us...FAIL. we ordered half a roll which was the no name and that was actually good. \n\nSo in my opinion, I think this place is popular for their rolls not the fish.

I had made a reservation for a table of four, two months prior to our visit to Vegas and even specified the Birthday on the reservation. We arrive at the Pub, 8 minutes early and are greeted in a frantic fashion from the hostess staff and are told to move over to the side and wait, as if we were in the way while they seat another party of 4 without a reservation, before us. What was the point of making a reservation? We waited patiently and another hostess comes over and gives is a choice- high top in the bar or wait until a table open ups in the dining area. Again, what was the point of a reservation? Annoyed at this point, we take the high top. Another customer is using one of our bar stools, so I kindly ask her if I can sit in the chair. The hostess should have done this. The server was fine. The food was okay, but the portions were very small and the Prime Rib special for $55 was a complete price gouge- a fatty slice with really silly sized sides of mashed potatoes and carrots. The 8 oz filet served with 3 puny asparagus stalks for $42 was another price gouge. The shepherds pie portion was very small. The roasted chicken was served in a massive plate with massive amounts of chick peas relative to the small size roasted chicken. We prefer smaller portion sizes, but the price here at GR Pub & Grill has increased too much for what we received. We ordered 2 desserts and they were good, not great.

{"text": "The most accurate way to describe Casa Nayarit is a somewhat authentic Mexican restaurant which takes many liberties with the Pittsburgh palate.  Judging from their true Mexican dishes Casa Nayarit deserves more than 3 stars, however, the compromised menu drops their authenticity and limits their overall rating in my mind.  \n\nHere is my candid review:  \n\nThe legitimate authenticity in part:  decor, price point, their salsas (tomatillo is roasted and amazing though their roja is way too mild - catering to the area), dishes such as bistec a la mexicana, ttampiquena, molcajete, camerones diablo, carnitas verde, carnitas ranchero, carne asada, enchiladas verde, tacos de pescada, huevos a la mexicana, & the friendly native language Spanish employees and more. I wonder why they do not serve mole other than perhaps the chefs are not from Oaxaca (hence the Nayarit name) and they don't want to sell the amazing sauce short of its true glory. \n\nThe standard Americanized liberties:  flour tortillas as the default option, giant burritos (burritos are not a true Mexican dish but places like Juarez and Sinoloa will serve a version due to the blurring Tex Mex lines in Northern Mexico), hard shell tacos, having to ask for lime wedges, lettuce and cheese as taco toppings (that is a BIG no-no, they should at least give customers a Mexican option with cilantro, onion and tomatillo sauce), no Jarritos, cheese smothered refried beans rather than true black or pinto beans, tortillas with melted cheese dip, as well as some other things on their menu.  \n\nAll in all, Casa Nayarit is a mid-Atlantic Mexican restaurant who must make financial ends meet hence the mostly understandable decisions to cater to all clientele.  They do a very good job, mostly, in using fresh, quality ingredients while trying to balance some of their root cuisine with a heavy Tex-Mex influence and food American palates are accustom to eating.  Their quality of food has always been excellent even when some of the flavors have been on the mild side.  I have been a customer around 30 times and ordered a large part of their menu. I have left pleased with taste of their dishes much more often than not. I wish they would add more spice to some of their traditional, authentic, genuine Mexican dishes, though. Having written that, they do have more than their share of the Hispanic community who eat in their restaurant.  That community seems to order a Molcajete.  It is an amazingly tasty, super flavorful, unique dish made in their own certain way served in a traditional molcajete.\n\nFor the most part, if you want AUTHENTIC, KNOW what you are ordering, and are very specific you can be very pleased. If you think you know authentic and order chips with cheese or a fajita burrito you will still be happy because the quality will be good. If you just want Americanized Mexican they have a place on the menu for you too. This is a nice, semi authentic restaurant (but please add soft corn tortillas as standard) on the verge of taking too many Tex Mex chances which distance themselves from their true Mexican roots. \n\nFood comparable to:  El Campesino with a more home style but less authentic feel. Recommended but YMMV.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "I always root for Cocina Mendoza because of two reasons:  first they are family owned and second, because they are simply such genuine, friendly people.   Those opinions aside, here is a candid review of the restaurant.\n\nCocina Mendoza is classified, in my mind, as a middling authentic restaurant with standard fare which takes liberties with the mid-Atlantic, or Pittsburgh, palate. Upon entering into the restaurant which has a fairly large sign outside its strip-mall location (free open lot parking) and legit clever decor inside (with music playing and big t.v.'s) you will seat yourself more often than not.  This is traditional.  \n\nYou will be greeted by one of several friendly, bi-lingual Spanish and English speaking employees who will bring you a basket of corn tortilla chips and red salsa.  The chips are from a bag.  I've had three of their salsas, the standard, the tomatillo, and the chile de arbol.  The standard, house salsa they bring free to your table may or may not be made in house but it is not made with fresh tomatoes or other fresh ingredients.  It is also somewhat sweeter than I prefer though that may be a product of covering up the use of canned tomatoes or perhaps their regional Acapulco recipe is just sweet.  I am not nearly as familiar with Acapulco as I am with many other regions of Mexico. The tomatillo sauce was warmed and has a consistency that reminded me of bottled salsas using corn syrup.  I did not like it either.  The chile de arbol was EXCELLENT the four or five times I've had it.  It tastes delicious, authentic, and spicy in every way. \n\nAfter trying the salsas, I could tell they are cutting corners in certain ways to make fiscal ends meet.  I totally understand these decisions however if I could make a recommendation to them:  start making 100% fresh, spicy authentic salsas and tortilla chips your family would eat. In this area, salsas set the table for what is to come.  I am confident Cocina Mendoza KNOWS this. As a customer, it is tough to change an opinion after a rough opening act. They will definitely bring in more customers if they properly set the table with an excellent salsa.  After all, they could always hide pre-made ingredients and cut corners with other less obvious dishes and unsuspecting palates.\n\nDespite two of the three failed salsas, I've had between 12 and 15 meals in the restaurant or used their take-out option.  I can easily attest to the fact that their CARNITAS tacos with fresh cut WHITE onion, FRESH cilantro, FRESH cut radish, and fresh lime wedges are truly mouthwatering, moist and delicious.  I believe they'd be proud to serve these tacos, which are on a double soft corn shell, to anyone in the Hispanic community.  Again, I rave about them because they are very, very, very good.  I've had other dishes from bistec to pollo to asada dishes which were  authentic and very well done!  I've also had popular dishes that were pre-made and Americanized (even if they shouldn't be) ... they weren't good and could potentially drive customers away with bad word of mouth experiences. I don't order food I know to be Americanized Mexican.  If I wanted that kind of food I'd just go to Mad Mex or another box restaurant.\n\nCocina Mendoza makes good food when staying true to their roots. However, they \"Americanize\"  many things, put items like extra big ground beef burritos on the menu, cut corners with obviously pre-made sauces (like enchilada ranchero sauce) or smother dishes with cheese masking depth of flavor leading many to question their overall authenticity and consistency. \n\nIn a smart, necessary business decision, Cocina Mendoza caters to all clientele. So, if you are going to go to Cocina Mendoza and order a true Mexican staple and you will almost certainly like your food.  If you order something that is not a traditional staple or you order an authentic something which has a suspect description, or order Tex-Mex you should expect the food to be average at best, watered down, prepared for a dull palate. \n\nOverall, in my opinion, Cocina Mendoza needs to stop trying to straddle the middle ground by being authentic with some things and cutting Americanized corners with others.

The kkang pung ki was this bright orange color, that I've never seen in a kkang pung ki before. it tasted like sweet and sour chicken (tang su yuk), and didn't have much spice.\nThe bokeum bop came with a jja jang sauce. Without the sauce it was so bland and honestly not good at all. The sauce made it edible.\nThe hwe dup bop had a good flavor - the kket nip and some other herbs really helped the dish.

How could I go wrong?\n\nI ordered chips and salsa, and the waiter brought some complimentary black bean tortillas with tomato butter.  I wolfed down one thick, leaden, undercooked flour tortilla and pushed the plate away.  Maybe the worst tortilla I've ever had!\n\nThe house tacos were just like the fajitas from any chain restaurant:  grilled chicken, steak, and shrimp with accompaniments: guacamole, beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  Shredded iceberg lettuce was the only vegetable.\n\nEach individual item was quite bland.  It all could have used a squirt of lime juice, some cilantro, or even just salt and pepper.  The gilled chicken was as tough as could be.  And the plain flour tortillas were nothing special.   I picked at the steak and shrimp and left the chicken.\n\nThen I made a huge blunder and ate a second black bean burrito.

Israel's has my truck for a day and they tell me my clutch, throw out bearing and such is bad as well as the slave cylinder.

Problem #1 They only accept cash (more of an inconvenience  than anything else)  Problem #2  After I pay I get in the truck and the transmission will not shift into gear.

In Canada, Marshals is really an extension of Winners: same merchandise, same prices, and I see no difference at all. The only improvement about Marshalls is the way they arrange their shoe section (by style, rather than by size). Other than that, Marshalls and Winners look and feel exactly the same, they just carry different  sizes of the same merchandise, and that's why I keep going back to visit these stores.

The same shirt, brand new, sells for much less at old navy  on the clearance rack ...I know, because I've got  dozens of them! I understand that they have a business to run but thrifting at such high prices just doesn't make sense to me.

The Thai Tea was meh.\n\nThe spring rolls were interesting. The menu indicated lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, sweet basil, cilantro, carrot and tofu. I received 4 rolls standing on one end. The top end overflowed with ingredients. The mint and basil were delicious. There was actually very little sprouts, and a lot more lettuce than in normal spring rolls. I prefer shrimp; however, I suspect they used Vietnamese pork sausage rather than tofu. Two rolls fell apart while trying to separate them from one another. While the actual spring rolls were lack luster, the peanut sauce included was actually quite good.\n\nThe soup included with the lunch special was a vegetable soup. I'm glad I asked, because they actually forgot to serve it to me. The Panang was not well done. Heat level was probably about a 3 (I asked for 15 on a scale of 1-10). The Panang was also very watery.\n\nI was disappointed. I don't think that I'll return to this restaurant again.", "stars": 2}

As a person from the San Francisco Bay Area, we don't have places like this because of the weather.  There were heated lights, but I believe that's unnecessary especially with the warm Arizona nights approaching.   Maybe for the Winter season. \n\nThe food was very good.  We started with chips and salsa and their nachos.  The salsa was full of flavor and they taste a lot better than Salty Senorita.  My wife and I ordered the the six pack Dos XX fish tacos and they were very good, which you can't go wrong because its just beer battered fish.  They definitely taste a lot better than Rubios that's for sure.    \n\nThey have live music Friday night and a huge Jenga block for anyone who wants to play.  \n\nThe waitstaff was friendly and they checked back at us here and there.  This place is definitely leaning towards a younger crowd, but it's a fun place to be.  Dos Gringos is a nice place for lunch and is great if you have a large group for dinner and drinks.  However, I do not recommend this place if you have young children because some of the signage that is posted on the wall and below the bar counters.  Some of the signage is inappropriate for young kids to read. \n\nThe prices are moderate, which is usually just right for Tex-Mex.  Furthermore, the drinks are inexpensive and you can play Jenga.

{"text": "My sister and I finally decided to try Loving Hut after wondering about it for a long time (and finally being on that side of town when they happen to be open). I ordered the Hawaiian Burger with Seasoned Fries and she ordered the Amazing Saut\u00e9 and an order of Spring Rolls. \nWe will start with mine. The burger was far from being such. It was two bland Tofurky-like patties covered in a less than satisfying teriyaki sauce with lettuce and tomato. There was definitely no pineapple on the burger and if there were saut\u00e9ed onions, I could not taste them at all. I did not notice vegenaise either. The burger was almost flavorless. The fries were good enough, but the seasoning that you pay extra for ruined them. It tasted like cheap chili powder with nothing else to bring out any flavor. Obviously, I was far from impressed with my meal, especially considering I could have made a much more flavorful vegan burger myself and it wouldn't have costed as much. \nNow for my sister's \"Amazing\" Saut\u00e9. First, she was confused as to why an Asian Saut\u00e9 didn't automatically come with rice. She was going to pay extra but had forgotten and decided to just try it without first. The food came out almost room temperature, which we ignored. She said that the onions and peppers were kind of good, while I found them to be flavorless (I had a couple bites of hers). I was impressed with the texture of the faux chicken, though overall, the dish was way too oily. You could see a pool of oil at the bottom of the dish. Then to add insult to injury, we found a hair in the middle of her food, long and dark. We both have light hair. For this reason, she lost her appetite and politely asked for a refund (no problem with the staff, they were very helpful). She only asked for a refund on the saut\u00e9, as she didn't mind the spring rolls, even though they were flavorless and the sauce was like sugar water. \nI really do not like writing negative reviews like this, but I felt this deserved it. We were not only completely underwhelmed, but down right disappointed in almost everything about Loving Hut (including their ridiculous hours). While we do hope they improve upon the quality for the sake of the vegan movement, we will not be returning.

{"text": "Bought a groupon and used a coupon code on that Groupon making this super cheap. I bought 6 treatments for my full face and neck and it cost me about $150 if I recall correctly. Remember, you definitely get what you pay for. As everyone else states, you have to make an appointment AT LEAST a month in advance or else you cannot be seen. Overflow appointments (which is what mine were) are not treated with respect. Think of it like Great Clips, it's get in and get out. The staff isn't very helpful, sometimes very rude. I was dissatisfied with 4 out of my 6 treatments. The first was nice because it was my intro to laser hair removal, but the rest (except my 4th) were weak and it irritated (mentally, not physically) me. The problem isn't the laser, the problem is that the staff wants to delay your results so that you sign up with their ridiculous contracts. The laser they use is the Candela GentlemaxPro. This laser is great...if used according to your needs. For 5 out of my 6 treatments, they had it set to its YAG setting, which is meant to be gentler for people with darker skin, meaning it's less effective overall. What made my 4th treatment great (besides the fact that Amanda was my technician and she's amazing) is that the laser was set to Alexandrite, which is meant for light skin and darker hair (Amanda was the only one who actually bothered to ask me my heritage in order to set it correctly). Of course, I didn't realize this difference until after researching it. I wondered why the treatments were so different in strength (and result), and I did inspect the screens of the lasers when the technicians left the room, which is how I knew what to research. Overall, my cheeks and neck are mostly clear, but my chin and upper lip are still pretty stubbly. I understand it takes a good amount of treatments, but I have no doubts that if they had actually used the Alexandrite laser for each of my treatments, I would be finished with the 6. \nIf you still wish to use Simplicity, request that they use the correct laser for you (so do your research). It's no use requesting a certain technician a month in advance, because they just set you up with whomever is working that day. I requested Amanda after my 5th treatment sucked, and on my 6th appointment, I didn't get her.

I not only saw them cleaned in the morning, they were checked in the evening as well.  Wonderful, so much better than the last year.  The stall walls have been cleaned.  The showers have no mold on one, way less mold on the other.  I wasn't completely grossed out at all this weekend. Woohoo.  Thank you and please keep up the good work. It is appreciated. \n\n2014 & 2015: I haven't seen any reviews on the marina bathroom, not the hotel. I didn't want to give it a bad review if I had been there just once.  After several visits over the course of two summers it gets a one. This is NOT a 1 visit review and they were short staffed, no excuse. Easily said the womens is nasty/disgusting and the mens I hear is worse. I must have missed their annual cleaning. From the looks of it, it isn't cleaned quarterly or semi annually.  The showers: fist size wads of hair, hair on the walls, water always on the floor, mold everywhere (not an exaggeration), no where to put your things while your in the shower. You have one hook, so hopefully you can figure out how to get your towel, changing into clean clothes, changing out of dirty clothes, your shampoo and items on that one hook. If you drop anything it's trash cause the floor is so gross. They really need to figure out the water on the floor issue, my thought would be lower the shower rod or get longer curtains, under $3 fix. \nStalls side: toilet paper on the floor, shit smeared on the stall walls (not one stall, several), broken toilets. Someone had dropped a pad paper backing on the floor, it was there for 4 days. The toilet paper had been restocked so I know they must have seen it. It would have taken less than 5 seconds to pick it up. Yes, the person that dropped it should have! The hygiene container hadn't been dumped in no telling how long, OMG, it stunk like there was stuff in there for months. Now broken tiles in the middle of the walkway which are really sharp. I only imagine how bad the mens is. Late one night my husband stuck his head in & yelled for me to see if I was still inside, he talked about much better the womens was, the mens was really really disgusting. It only takes a few minutes to run a broom or a mop through it. No money or effort is put into this bathroom. It does have a good supply of toilet paper, thank you for that. \nLet me also say I am a small town farm girl not some prissy city girl. I do have some type of clean standards and the marina bathrooms are off the chart disgusting.  \n\nThe restaurant is very good. The lake is nice. People need to be more conscience and not RUDE about driving fast on the dirty road and making the dust roll. People are camping close. We have a boat in the marina but there is no need to dust out those poor campers. Someone needs to grade the road.  If the resort is ever having money problems, do it yourself.

The staff is really great and friendly and helpful in answering your questions. The store area and the shooting range was remodeled not too long ago and the place looks awesome. They have a wide range of firearms, accessories and gear for all (most) of your shooting needs.\n\nHOWEVER, the reason that I only gave it 3 stars is because of their pricing.. I understand that they are a business and are here to make money and that they have to recoup the money they spent to modernize the place, so they have to get that money back somehow. The prices for range use have gone up. I could not tell you if they have gone back down since the last time I shot there but that was well over 6 months ago. It used to be $10 per person but was jacked up to $15. Not too much but significant enough for me to want to patronize other facilities especially if going with a group, that money can add up really quickly!! But one thing that never ceases to amaze me is how much they mark up the prices on most of their firearms! Alot of the time you will pay$100 to $200+ for the same weapon you could get a lot less from somewhere else in the valley.\n\nNice facilities, Nice staff, Bad prices!!", "stars": 3}
{"text": "They really have, in my opinion, the tastiest and crispiest version of Korean fried chicken I have ever had. I always look forward to visiting the location in Sunnyvale, CA when visiting family back home in the Bay. So I was very excited when I first learned this place was coming to Vegas. I've been here several times since they first opened and based off my own experience and seeing the other yelp reviews, I fear that Bonchon may not be around here too much longer if management/ownership doesn't make changes.\n\nThe main concern here is the value. As delicious as the chicken is, it has a premium price that doesn't match the product. When they first opened, the drums were almost twice the size of what they are now, making the price a little more reasonable. I suspect the reason for the change to smaller portions was due to the cooking time (twice-fried to give that signature crisp) being very long at first. This led to many earlier complaints, resulting in less repeat customers, the need to save money, the now odd hours/random closings, and shortages of some of the items on the menu (which they shouldn't have anyway), again all affecting repeat business. What makes Bonchon popular worldwide is the chicken, and that should be the focus. Bring back the big drums!", "stars": 3}

They have a wide variety of food there but like any spot  I go to that serve Mexican food I gauge the food by how good the carne asada tacos are and I must say that although they are a little bit pricier than what I am normally used to paying, they were very good! The meat was flavorful and juicy. The setup is similar to Chipotle or Zaba's were you pick what kind of filling you want. I went with the simple \"authentic\" onions, cilantro and salsa. The guy who was making the tacos was like \"is that all??? no lettuce or cheese?\". I know that most people who like to eat more Americanized tacos like to have lettuce and cheese and all that but no self respecting authentic Mexican food lover like myself would do that to a taco. I can see how that would justify the $3 each asking price though if you get one of those \"super duper supreme look i got all this stuff in my taco\" kinda tacos so I'm not knocking them on that. The other thing I got was the chicken flautas which actually were really good although I think they were frozen and not fresh. If I go back, I will have to try the enchiladas cause I love me some enchiladas too.\n\nOh and the staff is really nice and friendly too.

First one they didn't send the envelopes for the cards I ordered.  We ended up going out and buying envelopes on our own and requesting a refund for those.  Then I just had an order where they sent the envelopes and not the cards.  We had paid for delivery by a certain date, and we were on a tight timeline.  But we could do nothing about it and the cards arrived a week later.  These were problems caused by overnight prints, not the delivery service provider.  \nI also had a lot of trouble with their customer service with regards to pricing and VIP discounts.  Being a customer for many years we had earned our was to the highest level VIP Discount Pricing in their Loyalty Program, and I was finding that the prices I was getting under VIP Discount was the same or more than if I was just purchasing the item through the regular site sale they were running.  Didn't make sense, I tried to discuss with customer service and got the least interested and least helpful customer service rep I have ever spoken to.  \nAdditionally I had an order last year that had poor print quality - the first time I ever experienced this with OP.

We walked around after we ordered, because I am really into the atmosphere of where I choose to eat, and the other room with the fire place and the bar, which I thought was very North woods charming. I think that this place could be a mainstay forever...It truly has that charm. The menu is fantastic and I think the chef really thinks outside of the box. My main issue is the inattention to small details that really make a huge difference. We sat in the front room, in  a booth, and there were about 200 dead mosquitos in the window pane right beside where we were sitting. GROSS. I also think that if you are trying to have staying power, then make your own salad dressings. At least a couple signature dressings.

There is also no background music/noise, so the largest group's voices carried and were extremely loud.\n\nAlthough the food was good, the price was too high and did not reflect the value. I understand why the prices are high given the wealthy neighbourhood and size of the restaurant. However, I would not recommend this place unless you are willing to pay the price for those things. \n\nWe tried a number of dishes including the the peking duck, lemon chicken, pork buns, chili garlic prawns, and vegetable dishes. I would recommend the chili garlic prawns and lemon chicken. The peking duck was overpriced ($48) and there are other restaurants that serve it better at a more reasonable price.

Everything was fresh out of the oven. The cheesecake is the fluffiest cake I've ever had - it's more like a light sponge cake with a hint of cheesecake flavour. It's fluffy when freshly baked (we tried it 25 minutes after we bought it when we got home and it was still warm). After a day in the fridge it becomes a little denser but still not as dense as a regular cheesecake.\n\nThe madeleines are the size of cupcakes and are delicious and extremely buttery. They are only good the day of.\n\nCheesecakes are $8.88 and madeleines are $2.22 each but there was a deal to buy 3 and get the 4th free. \n\nI still prefer north american cheesecake (for example, Carole's cheesecake in yorkville) but I'm glad i tried it.

The price wasn't bad and the seafood, although not great, was better than you could find at the other buffets in town.  Unfortunately, the price went up and the quality of the food went down.  We checked out a other places, but few had a decent selection of seafood.\n\nWe heard some good reports of the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars and decided to check it out.  Once we navigated our way through the casino to find the buffet we were greeted by a long line waiting to get in.  Although there were probably at least 100 people in front of us, the line moved rather quickly and we didn't wait that long.  The price was about $45, but you can spend another $15 to move to the head of the line.  \n\nOnce in and seated you see the size of the serving areas--at least twice as large as any of the others we've been to.  They claim to have over 500 items on the menu.  We didn't stop to count them all, but that number probably includes all the sauces and different flavors of gelato.  \n\nWe tried sampling as many of the different dishes that we could.  Here's a quick overview of the different stations:\n\n* Seafood - this is what we came for.  Lots of choices including the standard shrimp and crab legs.\n\n* American Comfort - really good sweet potato tots.  The onion rings were ok, but nothing great.\n\n* Italian - Some good pasta and pizza choices here.  Didn't eat a lot since I tend to overstuff myself when eating pasta.  \n\n* Deli - lots of choices although some are the standard Tillamook cheeses I can pick up at Smith's.\n\n* Salad - large selection of greens and toppings.  Also a good selection of fruits and prepared salads.  Although we like salads, we tend to avoid them at buffets since they fill you up and don't leave room for the other items.\n\n* Carving - lots of choices, but the good stuff goes quick and you have to go back multiple times to see what's available.  Unfortunately, this was the worst station in the buffet.  Most of the meats were served cold and the ones that weren't were dried out.\n\n* Mexican - didn't try since neither of us is a fan of TexMex.\n\n* Sushi - tried a couple of the items (the tuna and salmon sashimi).  Ok, but not really our style.\n\n* Oriental section - My favorite station.  Everything I tried here was fantastic.  Hit this station multiple times.\n\n* Dessert - this is probably where most of their 500 items are.  Lots of cakes, pies, gelatos and other desserts to choose from if you have room left after eating everything else.  I had the red velvet cake (dry) and the bread pudding (better at Golden Corral).\n\nHere are some of the high/lowlights of some of the individual items that we sampled:\n\n* King crab legs - the ones on display are cold and you'll probably find a few that are still frozen.  Not much fun biting into a crabcicle.  They will cook them for you and we'd recommend that if you like your crab warm.\n\n* Shrimp--wow, they're already peeled.  They are on the large/jumbo size so they can have a mealy texture at times.\n\n* Clam buckets - not bad, but most of my clam shells were missing their clams.  Had to get multiple buckets to get all the clams I wanted.\n\n* Steamed Mussels - Ok, but after they're cooked they put them on ice.  They're just not as good that way as freshly steamed dipped in butter.\n\n* Oyster shooters - best to avoid.  Something just doesn't smell right with them and some folks have complained about being sick after trying one.\n\n* Oysters - they're west coast oysters, so there not as good as we could get in DC. They weren't bad, but we wouldn't recommend them unless you really have a craving for oysters.\n\n* Crab cakes/croquettes - very good\n\n* Wagyu sliders - delicious, although try to grab them when they're first put out; otherwise the rolls tend to dry out.\n\n* Prime Rib - sorry, I prefer my cooked meat warm, not cold.  That may have had something to with the texture of the meat.  Had better at The Feast at Santa Fe Station.\n\n* Lamb chops - delicious.  I probably ate more of these than anything else.\n\n* Chinese ribs - ok, but not that tender.  The meat should almost fall off the bone if they're done right.\n\n* Har Gow - a Chinese shrimp dumpling served in dim sum.  Never had one of these before and they were fantastic.  I'm not sure how many times I went back for more, but I grabbed some every time I visited the station.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad, but it really wasn't great either.  There's a large selection of items to choose from so no one should go hungry.  Is it worth $50 per person?  I didn't think it was that night.  Maybe they just had an off night on the carving station.  The meats looked good, but just weren't cooked right--this was what knocked the rating down to 3 stars.  We'll probably try it again, because even if you avoid the carving station, there are still plenty of other things to choose from.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "This was the first restaurant in Las Vegas that was supplied with one of the winners of Hell's Kitchen. It's been quite a few years since Heather West moved on to bigger and better things. It's a twin of Terra Verde at Green Valley Ranch- pretty much the same overpriced menu which shouldn't be surprising since both Executive Chefs were born in Milan and worked some of the same places through their careers. However, the staff here is much more attentive and definitely less snobbish than over at Green Valley Ranch.\n\nWe were leery about trying this place after our experience at Terra Verde a year earlier, but Station Casinos was doing another of their month-long promotions they use to drag the regulars into the casino and we had \"won\" $140 in dining vouchers. My mom and her boyfriend were wintering over in Vegas so we used the vouchers to take them out to dinner.\n\nJust as at Terra Verde, the atmosphere and d\u00e9cor are very nice with an intimate feel to them. Since it's on the higher end of the price scale for Italian restaurants, there aren't a lot of families with kids here so it's quiet as well. We made reservations for 6:30pm on a Thursday evening and were seated promptly when we arrived. Unlike Terra Verde, the staff here acted as though they were glad to see you. As with Terra Verde, the lighting was dim and we had to use our cell phone flashlights to have enough lighting to be able to read the menu. I guess we need to start taking our reading glasses with us.\n\nWe got the normal complementary bread basket with olive oil and balsamic along with the plate of hard cheeses, olives, peppers and zucchini chips (rumor has it that this plate has been discontinued.) For starters we shared orders of Calamari and shrimp scampi. Both were very good. For our main courses we had linguine clams, shrimp risotto, ossobuco, and veal parmesan. All the meals were very good; much better than what we had at Terra Verde. The ossobuco was extremely tender and the sauce was very flavorful. No real need to add additional seasonings to any of the meals. The only small complaint that we had was that the linguine clam sauce was a bit watery. It still had good flavor, but I would have preferred it just a bit thicker.\n\nAll in all a much better overall experience than what we had a Terra Verde.

The atmosphere and d\u00e9cor of the restaurant were very nice and gave it a romantic feel, but the lights were so dim we had to use our cell phone flashlights to read the menu. The romantic feel was dispelled by our wait staff. Although prompt and courteous, they were a bit stuffy, almost to the point of being snobbish. Green Valley isn't the upscale, trendy neighborhood it once was so they need to adjust to their clientele.\n\nWhile you're waiting for your food, you get the standard bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar along with a plate that has a selection of cheeses, olives, peppers and zucchini chips. If you like the harder cheeses like parmesan and Romano (we do), you'll enjoy this while you wait for your food. We skipped the starters and went straight for the main course.

Don't be a putz. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in town to visit.\n\nI ordered the wild mushroom risotto and Brenda had the veal parmesan. The risotto was tasty and seasoned, but somehow I was expecting something a bit more. The portion size was ok, but certainly didn't fill me up. I think a smaller portion served as a starter would be better than the undersized dinner portion that cost $30. Brenda's veal also had good flavor and although the portion size was correct for dinner, it was a bit on the tough side.\n\nBeing underwhelmed by dinner, we skipped dessert and headed over to Starbucks for a couple of lattes.

After a long wait in line we finally were seated and greeted by a waitress who didn't seem like she really wanted to be there either (she probably already tasted the food).\n\nWe ordered our coffee and juice and stared at the menu. Brenda and I both have an adventurous palate and are willing to try anything at least once. However, there is a difference between adventurous and just plain crazy. When you read the menu, nothing jumps out and says \"Hey! Pick me! I'm really tasty.\" Quite the opposite--the food and flavor combinations of everything except the pancakes don't even begin to sound like they'll work together. However, to be polite, we placed our orders and waited for the food. I had the only thing that sounded somewhat normal to me; the corned beef has with red onions and Swiss cheese. By the way, they have a no substitutions policy and they do enforce it.\n\nThe service here isn't any better than the food. Wait staff is slow and you may or may not have everyone's meal served at the same time.As we waited for the food to arrive, we saw that the portions they brought out were huge--even bigger than what we get at Black Bear. Unsurprisingly, with the amount of people here, the wait for the food was about 40 minutes, which is a bit long for breakfast. Apparently because the food is all \"homemade\", it prevents the kitchen staff from having any type of timing system to ensure everyone at the table is served at the same time. When my food was placed in front of me, I just kind of stared at it. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered corned beef hash. Instead of a neat presentation, I faced a huge pile of potatoes and the hash topped with a slice of cheese and two overcooked eggs. Sticking out of the top of this monstrosity was a rosemary tree. Normally, I would expect something like this to have the hash grilled and then have the cheese placed on top and remixed once it the cheese melted before putting it on the plate. I also expected the \"crispy\" potatoes to be on the side. Since they were thrown in with the hash, they were soggy from all the grease.\n\nThe food itself lacked any real flavor and no amount of salt and pepper really did anything to improve it. Sure, the portions were huge, but that just meant more wasted food at the end of the meal. Quality is a bit more important that quantity.\n\nTheir motto is \"Twisted Farm Food.\" I'm not sure what farms they're visiting, but it doesn't conjure up any memories of food I ate growing up in Pennsylvania Dutch country.

Certainly, Californians will tell you that they have good seafood there, but everything we've had there, from San Diego up to Fisherman's Wharf, just doesn't seem to have the same flavors as that found along the Atlantic seaboard. Kings Fish House in Henderson comes the closest so far since many of the dishes they prepare are made with seafood imported from the east coast.\n\nWe were in the Henderson and were planning to eat at Lucille's, but the wait in line was longer than normal so we thought we'd give this place a try. It was an early Saturday afternoon and surprisingly the place was empty considering the wait in line at Lucille's. We were quickly seated and since there were only 2 or 3 other occupied tables when we arrived, we pretty much had the waiter all to ourselves. We'd have to rate the service as 5 stars because of this, but if the restaurant was full, it might not have been as good. The menu is filled with items from all over the world-from Ecuadorian Mahi Mahi to Maine lobster to Alaskan halibut. So many choices, so little time-looks like this is going to be another of those restaurants that requires multiple trips.\n\nAfter some deliberation I went with the New England Clam Bake which included a 1 14 lb. Maine lobster, steamed clams and mussels, red potatoes and corn on the cob. Brenda had the crab cakes. It didn't take long for the food to arrive--after all, how long does it take to steam some clams and boil a lobster? The crab cakes weren't great, but they weren't bad either. Better than what you can find in your frozen food aisle, but definitely nowhere close to what you can get along the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. The lobster was pretty good even though a bit on the small side. The clams and mussels were ok, but could have been better if they used mollusks from somewhere other than the Pacific...perhaps, I don't know, maybe NEW ENGLAND in their New England Clam Bake?!?\n\nDon't get us wrong. This may not sound like a great review of the restaurant, but the food was good and we'll definitely go back again. Everything we had was better than the seafood at any of the buffets in town. However, having grown up on the east coast where we could get fresh seafood right off the boats, my tastes may be a bit jaded.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "We've tried both of Chef Ramsay's other restaurants here in town decided it was time to get the last one out of the way.  We stopped in after work on Friday afternoon after work (about 4:00) and got good seats right near the kitchen where we could watch everyone working.  We really wanted to like the place, but it just didn't live up to expectations.\n\nInitial observations:\n   1. The wait time was short--only about 5 minutes from the time we got in line until we were seated.\n   2. It's a hundred and a bazillion degrees outside--why is the line right next to flaming \"artwork?\"\n   3. More tacky outfits for the hostesses and waitresses.  We understand the premise, but they just aren't flattering; at least not on the women here.\n   4.  Hostesses are carrying around the iPad paperweights just like at GR Pub & Grill.  We thought we'd be looking at them to order our drinks, but after seating us, she took it with her.\n\nIt was only a few minutes after being seated that the waiter showed up and took our drink orders.  I thought that this was also a bar where I could order a bear with my burger, but apparently not.  No beer in sight on the menu--strange since they have beer glasses for sale at the front of the restaurant.  Learned later that yes, the airhead that was our hostess was supposed to leave the iPad with us.  Of course, our waiter (who never gave us his name) didn't even ask about alcoholic drinks or let us know that they were available.  \n\nWe thought we'd order different burgers and split them between us so we could sample more than one while we were here.  Brenda ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger (avocado, jalapeno, and roasted tomato) without the jalapeno, and I ordered the Farm Burger (duck bacon, fried egg, and French cheddar).  We also ordered both the sweet potato fries and the truffle Parmesan fries.  We had them bring the fries out first so we could snack on them while we waited for the burgers to arrive. The waiter left with our order and we never saw him again until it was time to pay the bill.\n\nWhile we waited for our food we watched the drama in the kitchen.  One of the food runners must have been having a bad day because every time we saw her in the kitchen area she was crying and the expediter was spending his time consoling her.  Another of the employees working the pass was so short that she couldn't reach the food that the staff was putting under the heat lamps.  We watched two orders of fries sit there for the 15 minutes it took to get us our food.\n\nA food runner brought us our fries and we think she was explaining what the different dipping sauces were that came with each order.  The Parmesan fries come with an aioli mayo and ketchup and the sweet potato fries come with some sort of jalapeno dip and a powdered vanilla sugar.  The sweet potato fries were excellent--nice and crispy although Brenda thought the sugar made them just a bit too sweet.  The truffle Parmesan fries had good flavor, but were limp and soggy without any hint of crispness; almost as if the oil they were cooked in wasn't hot enough.  I enjoyed the sauces that came with both fries.  Brenda really didn't care for either and thought they overpowered the sweet potato fries.\n\nWhen our burgers arrived, we cut each and half to share.  Both burgers were cooked as ordered--medium on the Hell's Kitchen burger and medium rare on the Farm.  The Hell's kitchen burger was OK, but nothing to get excited about.  The burger itself was seasoned well; however, it just lacked that wow factor.  It could be that the jalapeno was supposed to add that, but unfortunately, not everyone can eat jalapenos.  The Farm Burger was fantastic.  As soon as we sliced into it, the egg yolk oozed down the sides.  This is one burger you probably want to eat with a knife and fork. The duck bacon added a nice smoky flavor to it, although Brenda thought it was a bit heavy for her tastes.\n\nAll during dinner, one of the busboy/runners kept our drinks filled at all times.  He was by our table when our waiter finally showed up to give us the check and noticed the card was from USAA and immediately struck up a conversation about the military.  Semper Fi, Marine!  You were the only bright spot out of the entire wait staff.  When the waiter came back with the receipt and card, he made the mistake of handing it to me and ignoring Brenda (who was paying the bill).  If we hadn't found out from the Marine that they pool tips here, this waiter would have gotten a big fat zero tip.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad experience--it just wasn't what we were expecting after eating in Ramsay's other restaurants.  The food was ok, but for the price it should be a lot better than Red Robin.  The service, with the exception of one person, pretty much sucked--not sure if the Culinary Union has their hooks in this place, but if they do, that could explain the service problems.  Hopefully this will be like GR Pub & Grill and the second visit will be better than the first.", "stars": 3}

We went this past Monday at 5:30 - not exactly what I would call a busy time. We had bread, salad, and food within 30 minutes, so we were feeling very rushed. I wasn't even halfway through my entree when the server was already coming by asking if we wanted cappuccino. The food was sub-par, nothing to write home about (the salad was DRENCHED in dressing and inedible). They gave us two carafes of wine - one white, one red. There were 5 of us, and we were never offered any more. From seating to signing the bill was exactly 1 hour. We asked our server Gerson for another carafe as we still had quite some time to kill before our show. His response was, \"I can absolutely give you more wine; however I need this table so you will need to drink this in the lounge.\" I have NEVER in my life been asked to get up from a table, ESPECIALLY after only one hour. We were absolutely appalled, and this will probably keep me from going there in the future.", "stars": 2}

They're really outgoing and accommodating. Also, the interesting pizza choices and toppings are pretty nice. If you want to drink, they have beers and wine.\n\nCons: Gotta especially say \"eh\" to the pizza. The woman and I went in with a buy one get one coupon, and ended up paying about $10. The pie itself is probably around 8-10 inches, but it's one of those places that has the really thinnish crust and the toppings are kinda scant for that price. I get that they're new and maybe there's some overhead being in that place or something, but I dunno. Speaking of the place/atmosphere, it's not so bad; except it's pretty small and pretty much all the seating is directly in the afternoon sun, as the storefront is all glass and they have no blinds or anything. \n\nAnyway, back on the pizza: It wasn't really that good. Somewhere inbetween a Kashi frozen pizza and maybe Brixx or something. Also not sure what's so innovative about their \"concept\" that the other reviewers are talking about; pretty sure you can get pizza made however you want at any other pizza place.\n\n\nAll-in-all, I'm probably not going back but I won't say it's a horrible place or anything.", "stars": 3}

I used to work at a place that had 20 inch pies and I remember having to fold the annoyingly big box. When I saw this box, I was skeptical of the size. When the wife and I got it home, we went anal and measured it. Sure enough, not 20\".

{"text": "Not sure about these guys.\n\nI took my car here, twice. Both times I asked for service on certain things and straight-up didn't receive it. It wasn't like they charged me for anything they didn't do, but they just seemed to be more about getting the car in and out the door instead of doing what I asked. \n\nThe first time I just wanted the 50,000 mile service, y'know the deal in the owner's manual. Well, they pretty much just changed the oil and even left a dirty air filter in. I figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt since it was a (maybe) busy Friday and plus, they're walking distance from my house; so, I gave them another shot. The second time, I came in with a 3x5 card detailing everything I wanted done and made sure the fella understood, as I was going driving cross-country. He said it'd all be done (This was the 57,000 mile thing) and apologized for leaving a dirty air filter in the time prior, that he'd fix it. He did for free, which was nice.\n\nAnyway, an hour and a half later I got a call that they were finished. The mechanic said he looked at a lot of stuff himself, but some other guys did stuff on my list and checked off what they did and put it in the car. When I got the list, only one thing was checked and they even put \"N/A\" next to \"check fuel filter\". Were they saying the car had no fuel filter? Because it does and I'm not getting why it couldn't be checked. What about the other items?\n\nAgain, they didn't charge me for anything they didn't do; at least I don't think so, as it was like $70... but I'm just not sure what they didn't do (did they have time to rotate the tires, or?...et cetera). I didn't say a limit on how much I wanted to spend and I was willing to wait all day for the car to be done, so I just don't understand. It's a weird place, and I'm not into it.

She informed me of the exact opposite, saying they have always charged for it and pointed to the owner. I said \"All right, well let me talk to the owner.\" \n\nShe went to the owner, came back and said \"She won't talk to you, but she says we have always charged for this since we have to pay for the club soda.\" I dunno about that last part, seems fishy, but then she said \"You were just lucky the other times.\" I joked \"Well, I guess my luck ran out!\" and she just gave me a rude stare; creepy, man.\n\nFood was all right, as per usual, and I didn't even have to pay since my friend was treating my lady and me for our upcoming anniversary, but that kind of inconsistency and customer-blaming is bad service.

I see other tables getting plates inbetween ours, so this just makes no sense; work on one order at a time, geez.\n\nThe food is also kind of hit-or-miss: sometimes you get a tasty treat and sometimes it's just a bunch of really overcooked or impossible-to-chew fatty meat atop rice.

Don't see a lot of that, especially being in the BIG CITY.\n\nThe only other thing I want to comment on is the wait time. It seemed pretty long for our pizza. When we got in, we were the only folks who didn't already have our food on the table. We ordered promptly, but it still took about 30 minutes to get the pizza.

I'm not keen on all the new stuff, but luckily there's a lot of stuff from the 50s-90s to choose from. The problem is not in the lack of choice, but the impossibility of finding anything in their system. It's almost like the now olden days when you used to download mp3s with incorrect artist tags; I might search for Elton John and see a few of his songs, then be searching manually through a list of songs/artists, and find songs by him not on the artist page which also claim he's a Korean singer. It's weird and clunky.\n\nAnother thing is that the user interface is clearly geared toward Chinese people. I get it because it seems the owners are Chinese and there's a large presence of Chinese at the nearby ASU campus or whatever, but many of even the American artists are written in Hanzi, so it's really hard to find what you're looking for unless you happen to read and/or happen to be able to write English people's names in Hanzi.\n\nAs for the quality, it's kind of a typical karaoke machine. The newer stuff is clearly better in terms of audio quality, as older stuff has a lot of MIDI and really corny videos made with really corny people on one weekend in 1992.\n\nI think if selection was made easier and the price brought down a bit (Again, I didn't pay, but the usual prices without the Groupon seem pretty steep) then I think this would be a cool place to hang out with pals and sing the night away.

{"text": "This place is a big disappointment, especially considering the positive experience I had in the 2 years I had a membership at a Planet Fitness back east.\n\nFirst off, let me say I'm an alumni of Gold's Gym and other gyms where there really is an annoying atmosphere of jockos and jerks who make gym-going irritating. That said and the fact I was a patron of PF in the past, I understand and am fine with the \"No lunks\" mentality.\n\nHOWEVER, I was surprised at sign-up how such an ostensibly tolerant place could seriously have a sign when you first walk in with so many \"NO\"s on it; no this, no that. I should've headed the other way when I saw two, in particular: \"No dead lifts\" and \"No gallon water jugs.\" (I've never actually seen anybody with gallon water jugs at a gym, even a lunk-filled gym...but I still kind of read this as \"NO WATER.\")\n\nNow, I know dead lifts can be irritating as the stuff slams and I myself don't like them because you have to have good form to not jack your back, but come on; they're a good exercise. The real point I'm trying to make here, and one I was lied about on, is that they do not have barbells of any kind. I should have taken a tour, but the guy assured me they do have barbells. Well, I guess if you consider Smith machines barbells, they have them. I mean, you can't even do a simple thing like a barbell bench press, unless you want all the stabilizing done for you. I'm no bodybuilding brah, but THAT'S WEAK, BRAH.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a new thing at PF, as my old PF had barbells and reasonable people were doing squats, dead lifts, and bench presses without being \"lunks,\" but I guess we just can't be trusted to be reasonable, anymore.\n\nNext, the placement of things in this particular PF is annoying. It seems you have to walk here there and everywhere to find different things. Some leg machines are in the middle of the gym in this weird area ahead of the treadmills, others are behind this cordoned-off zone, et cetera. Minor gripes, but highly irritating when you don't have a lot of time to gym-it-up like I don't.\n\nI also got told to not run barefoot on the treadmill, though I was wearing clean socks. I dunno if it's some policy thing or they just think I'm a dirtball, but I thought it was kind of dumb.\n\nAnyway, my main thing here is I haven't had a gym membership for about a year; I was using the gym at the apartments I was residing in Paradise Valley before I moved to Tempe, and had been waiting to get to a \"real gym\" with barbells at the very least. It's just kinda sad that this place actually feels like a step down from the apartment gym, and that I'm paying for it.\n\nOn the plus side (maybe) they have red light therapy and massage chairs and are open 24 hours, but if you're looking to work out like I am those are kinda neat frills, but not a viable concession for not having the most basic of gym equipment.", "stars": 2}
{"text": "Pretty much agree with what Alan J. V said. It's a nice place, but so much of the food is bland.\n\nWe got a Groupon deal for the picnic platter thing that had 2 lbs of meat total, 3 sides, and even got free cobbler since it's free on Fridays...LOTS of food. We got pulled chicken, beef brisket, pork sausage for mains; beef brisket was good, had a nice smoky flavor. Chicken and pork sausage were okay, but really needed salt or something. The sides were lackluster (mashed potatoes, mac, and baked beans), but the beans were really super-bland. Toss some molasses in 'em, guys! We got corn bread that seemed like it was a \"third-party\" corn bread they had heated up. The barbecue sauce at their condiment station is not so good, either; came home and put Trader Joe's KC sauce on the leftovers, made it so much better. The cobbler was nice.\n\nI was impressed with how nice and helpful all the staff was, especially the girl who did our order; I imagine she gets tired of going through how it works numerous times each day, but she was peppy and explained things like she was super-interested. The confusion is that they have \"premium meats\" that they upcharge $4 for, which is disappointing but I guess makes sense (The premium ones are bone-in stuff like ribs and tri-tips).\n\nAtmosphere is nice, very homey.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "I appreciate that this place makes things with decent ingredients and \"OLDE TIME\" Swiss methods, so three stars.\n\nMost of the \"things\" (doughnuts, cookies) are pretty run-of-the-mill in taste, however, and for the calorie investment I'm making, I want more flavor. \n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, the plain cake doughnut makes the grade; they don't douse it with sugar glaze so it has a natural \"sweet bread\" flavor (not sickly sweet like most pastries). Also, like others have said, the crisp and scrumptious exterior really drives it home.\n\nMy big cautions with this place are two: 1) Do NOT get anything with chocolate; it seems everything chocolate there, including made by the chocolatier daughter next door, has taken on the taste of the smell of the building (if that makes sense). It's really off-putting to bite into something expecting the pleasure that is chocolate and get some weird sockish taste.  I guess I'll add the caveat that their cookies are not the soft variety, but more of a crunchy consistency; I hate that. Anyway, 2) Expect a bad attitude. I dunno, when I go in here the staff all seems like the other customers and I are irritating them. I notice this prima donna-ish attitude seems to be a thing amongst bakers, but it's pretty obnoxious. A few of the workers (including, I believe, the aforementioned \"daughter\") were pretty nice, but mostly it's sad sacks all around.\n\nStill, I guess you can be pretty sour if the stuff you make tastes sweet enough for people to come back!", "stars": 3}

While it makes your mouth want more, in my case my head was asking why I was eating a pizza doused in ketchup. Okay, so it wasn't that bad (in fact it was highly tasty), but y'know. I just wonder how it would've tasted with normal sauce.\n\nAnyway, what I really want to comment on here is the customer service: I was impressed! I like when I go to a place and you can tell the people really give a damn about your experience and aren't flashing the fake \"Scottsdale\" smiles that have been rigorously trained into them by some customer service guru or whoever it is who thinks anybody likes that junk.

{"text": "Pretty good Mediterranean fare. I had beef shawarma atop hummus, and my tablemates all had other varieties of shawarma with the rice deal. It was fine, not too burnt like is often found at places that serve the stuff. The house-made pita was nice, and we had their take on samosas (beef filled mini-pies) which were called something else but same thing; pretty tasty.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice and fitting, given the theme. Middle Eastern-style music, upholstery, et cetera. The only off-putting things that stop me from giving this place 4 stars are 1) the bathroom, which was composed of all very-old elements (toilet, sink) and was pretty gross. It's an old building, I understand, but y'know. Other thing was we were seated at a table which was directly next to an exit door. Pretty sure that's a fire hazard. My final gripe for this otherwise-okay place: They brought out my food by itself and thus my tablemates had to wait. This should be a cardinal sin in restaurants; if you had seen any of my other reviews, you'd know how annoying I find it as it's pretty unnecessary. I'll save you the rant, but just say if you start a restaurant please refrain from allowing that mess.\n\nOther than that, all was fine.

{"text": "Went on a Friday night at about 10:30pm for a late dinner.  It was a nice night out and definitely not conventional dinner time so we were seated quickly inside the restaurant while the patio remained popping with young professionals having drinks.  Some middle-aged men were drinking at the bar inside.  The service was great, most likely because no one else was eating at this hour.  The restaurant itself looks great, no criticisms there.  Clean and homey, nice mood lighting.\n\nMost meals come with their appetizer salad.  I asked for their house special Lemon Mustard dressing.  It was an excellent choice and I highly recommend it.  It tastes like honey mustard but lightened so it's appropriate as a dressing and not as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets XD\n\nTwo glaring flaws about our dinner -- my Charles Pasta was too salty and my friend's Chicken Roulade was too bland.  It was ridiculous.  I tasted my pasta and did an Alex Guarnaschelli when she's judging on Chopped, thinking in my head \"Did you taste your food?  No?  Well, you definitely substituted salt for sugar.\"   The Charles Pasta probably would've benefited from sugar rather than salt, since it contained sausage already, which provides much of the salty flavor.  I tasted my friend's Chicken Roulade.  The salt should've gone there, for sure.\n\nThe chocolate torte cake for dessert was delicious and redeemed the meal somewhat.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "I was put off by the attitude I got at this place.  I didn't like how the guy taking my order belittled me for not ordering any appetizers or drinks.  I also don't like the handwritten signs that made excuses for why their service is slow and why they don't let non-patrons use their bathroom (a simple \"customers only\" would work, but no, they have to go into great lengths to explain that toilet paper is expensive and therefore only their \"friends\" -- the customers -- can use the toilets blah blah).\n\nThat aside, decor (minus the handwritten signs) is great.  I felt like I was at a noodle stand in southeast Asia.  I enjoyed my Cambod-Ican noodle soup (their take on pho).  I normally don't like pho because it tastes too much like MSG but it wasn't so bad here.  I tasted my friend's crispy noodles and thought it tasted like really sweet, low quality Chinese take out lo-mein (but at least the noodles were sufficiently crispy).  My other friend found her vegetable curry with chicken to be too spicy for her liking.\n\nThe whole payment system is awkward.  Why not just take payment when I order at the window?  Why do I have to awkwardly and deliberately put on my coat in full view of the window to signal them to come out and give me the check?  It's beyond me.", "stars": 2}

Granted it has been over a year since I've been to any Red Lobster so maybe there were changes across all Red Lobsters.  But that's just me giving them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nTo start, we ordered a new menu item, Lobster Nachos, as an appetizer.  It was disappointing as it was mostly cheese and sour cream and hardly any lobster.  Thus it ended up coming off as just a heavy dish.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the stuffed flounder (not sure the exact name).  It was pretty good.  The portion was about right for the price.  The only downside being that it was a bit too salty -- some lemon juice might've helped.\n\nAnd the cheddar bay biscuits.  This was the main reason we made the drive from Pittsburgh city to Red Lobster.  The biscuits were disappointing.  Like the nachos, it was also heavy.  It was also flat as if not enough yeast (if any?) was added.  It was mushier than fluffy.  Utterly disappointing, but still ok.  Ok at best.  If you like the biscuits from fried chicken places, this is still lighter than those and a class above.  But yea.\n\nThe one redeeming quality was the service.  The food came out surprisingly quickly, except for the biscuits, which the waitress forgot to get for us.

It was watery, but didn't water down the taste so it's forgivable.  My boyfriend had the ravioli (I forget what the filling was, but I don't think it was vegetarian).

After spending some solid hours at this place, I began to think that their music collection consists solely of Rock Band soundtracks, not that this is a bad thing but... some Irish songs once in a while would be interesting.  It also goes without being said that American sports are shown on the TVs but whatever.

The fish wasn't super fresh, some of the cuts of fish were thin and cut poorly, falling apart.  Most of the rolls had the same notes of lots of imitation crab meat mixture, so they all tasted the same.  \n\nAppetizers-\nI'm a fanatic for raw oysters, they had small Pacific oysters that were a bit on the warm side and very bland tasting, flavorless even with the siracha sauce they dotted on it.  It tasted as though it was about to go bad and they rinsed it with tap water, even the shell the oyster was served in lacked oyster liquor, which isn't a good sign.  Needless to say, I was only able to eat 1 of 4 that I ordered and it was a struggle to keep it down.  I've eaten raw oysters from a jar and the raw oysters here came pretty close to that.  I told the wait staff that the oysters were a bit off and she replied, \"that's odd they're usually not like that\".  The manager was attentive and came to our table to see if we wanted more oysters, stating that there wasn't enough sauce on our previous order as to why they tasted that way. If the oysters are fresh, why would you need to drown it in \"sauce\"?\n\nThe sweet shrimp with side of fried heads, amaebi, were not so sweet, which means they weren't so fresh.  The shrimp heads weren't prepared properly, (not fried well) and so it was tough to bite through it.\n\nAfter having the oyster and amaebi, we passed on the uni, because if you can't get the other 2 right, there's no way we were going to try the uni as it needs to be super fresh.\n\nThey were pretty busy for a Tuesday night, so maybe I just have high expectations for sushi, or maybe we just got the Sushi chef in training, but if your like me and your jonesing for some great sushi, this place isn't for you.", "stars": 2}

{"text": "Hello again!\n\nHere is my follow up, albeit a little late, but whatever! I don't get paid for this!\n\nI have to say the year I spent in Galleria Palms was a pretty good year. No bug problems, only 3-4 police visits (more on that later), clean facilities, and helpful staff. There were a few issues, but on the whole, I can still recommend them to friends and family looking for a good place to stay so long as they're careful about a few things.\n\nSo, where to start? The maintenance staff were great. I had a few things break, and they were quick to come out and repair them. The first was the A.C. which I talked about in my first post. It never really ended up keeping the house cool, because the thermostat was in the coldest place in the house, and the living room couch was in the hottest place in the house by a south facing window. There wasn't much they could do about that unfortunately. I had a faucet break in my master bath, and quickly called maintenance, at ~1am because I kept twisting the handle under the sink and the water wouldn't cut off. I got a call back from the property manager ~10 minutes later telling me to pull it not twist (God i'm an idiot sometimes!). They swapped it out that morning. Then I had a garbage disposal crack and blow up. They fixed that a few hours after I called as well. Unfortunately, they didn't clean up too well, and the house smelt pretty bad for a few days. Lastly, the A.C. broke a few days before I moved out, but I really wasn't concerned at that point, because I was already moved in elsewhere.\nDuring my stay here, they started repainting the curbs, dumpster areas, and road markings. It's much better looking now. I also rented a garage for a few months which had just been painted. They definitely do work hard to maintain appearances. \nOn to the police. I had some neighbors move in above me, and god did they know how to stomp. I couldn't hear 90% of the us-60 traffic right outside of my window, but I could hear them stomp 24/7. Turns out, they were pretty pissed off at me for \"working on that motorcycle with power tools at all times of the day and night in the living room\". Problem was... My motorcycle never came inside my apartment. They called security on me twice, and the police 3 times over the span of a month of them moving in. Finally I went to see Caleb the asst. mgr, and asked him what the heck was going on with these people. He had dealt with them, and they mistook my AIR CONDITIONER as me working on my motorcycle! They still thought I was too loud, though, even though I mostly was at home to sleep, and moved out. They got theres though... they pay the pet fees, and had to buy new carpets for the apartment they left.\nThat brings me to the fees. I probably paid for 2-3 months of extra rent in fees. This was COMPLETELY my fault, as my pay days were staggered. Make SURE to pay them on the first. They are serious about on-time payment.\nI also spent 2-3 days cleaning before I moved out. Even so, I still lost my deposit and ~$50 out of pocket. They needed to clean the floorboards, stove shields, and dryer. A bit pricey in my opinion, and I shudder to think what would have happened had I not spent DAYS shampooing the carpet, scrubbing the walls and floors, cleaning the windows, fans, doors, etc...\nSo there is the bad and good. In a nutshell, pay on time, clean when you leave, and you'll love it there.\nWhy did I leave? My roommate moved out 6 months in to the 1 year commitment, and I didn't want another. Also, a friend of mine offered me a room down the street for much less, and I  don't need the space of a 2br/2ba. Oh, and the $80/mo bump in rent on my renewal agreement (even though I could go to their site and get the same apt (even the same apt. #) for $70 less than what was offered in the renewal).", "stars": 3}

That said, when people tell me to do this (typically happens at this Burger King), I put the car in park and tell them politely that I'll wait.

Everyone pretty much agreed that there was nothing particularly remarkable about the food. It is what you would expect. For what you get, I honestly felt like it was over priced a bit. Shrimp fajitas were $20 for about 10 medium sized shrimp and some fried vegetables. Should have been priced lower at $15 for what it was. I asked for no cilantro but got it anyway so maybe I was already a little let down about that.\n\nIf you are into motorcycles, they have staged cycle with a blue screen behind it.

I had the Waldorf salad sandwich and it was everything I had hoped for, but nothing special.  Everything else about the experience was forgettable.  The last few times I've been up there though I found that I like the place a lot more.  Recently I went after costume shopping solely to try their monster mash brew.  The bartender was cool and the beer was fantastic.  It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be- not because I thought it would be horrible, but it's hard to make a standout pumpkin beer with things like Southern Tier Pumking running amok.  Super tasty.  Another time I went with my girlfriends.  The service, for lack of a better word, was: bitchy.  The food made up for the attitude though.  Sampling a bit of everything we all split queso dip, a bucket of burgers with beer battered fries, a Rueben on potato pancakes, and the meatloaf dinner.  Everything was delectable. The burgers were terrific and the fries were addicting.  Ruebens are a weakness of mine and this one was topnotch.  I'm a sucker for meatloaf and this one was one of the best I've ever had while dining out.  The portions are generous.  The interior of the place is pretty sweet.

For years I lived under the delusion that this place would be decorated like a swanky grotto with cool lighting and a slightly fancy atmosphere.  I don't know where I got these ideas from because that's certainly not the case.  The inside reminded me of the scary parts of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  I'm pretty sure our waiter was drunk.  I'm not judging him, it was just slightly disconcerting.  I ordered fish tacos to start with, another lapse in my mental coordination.  A red flag went up in my head when I saw a cook stick his big, hairy arm through the pass window to show the waiter a cut of something which the waiter sniffed and shrugged at.  I became worried and rightfully so.  The tacos were one of the worst things I have ever tasted.  The smell that hit me as I took my first and only bite was inexplicable.  They were beyond fishy, like dead fish floating for a week in Lake Erie fishy.  The waiter cleared the plate not asking why we weren't eating them or if everything was all right.  Okay, so second stupid move I made was to order the crabby patty or whatever they call their burger with a crab cake on it.  I've made the mistake of ordering crab cakes from other places in the area and I guess I'm a glutton for punishment because I can't seem to get it out of my system.  The crab meat was salty, gritty, and fishy, which was a shame because underneath it all the burger meat was decent.

I have had the chicken pot pie once, and from what I can remember it was tasty, but every time I've been there and asked for it since, it's always been sold out.  As far as other dishes, I don't know what to say because I don't know how to feel about entrees that tastes like nothing.

Breakfast is good- French toast and bacon, eggs Benedict, build your own omelets- actually typing about it is making me long for it tremendously.  The appetizer sampler is still a compellation of tasty fried nonsense, but it is satisfying.  I like the idea that you can order an entire pie and eat it at the table.  I've never done so, but I have seen it done.  The only word to describe the service is: fine.

To make a long story short (too late) when we were finally able to sample this place's wares we shared a cheesesteak and a Rueben.

Once inside we were able to get drinks relatively easily and the bartenders were very friendly. \n\nLiving in NYC and being very familiar with the club scene I would say that Muzique lacks in a few aspects. First I think that the coat check line should never be as long as it was considering the club is in Montreal and the winters are brutally cold. If you know the demand is going to be high (aka everyone who enters will be wearing multiple layers and coats) it would be beneficial to hire more staff to do the coat check. Additionally, I had to enter a back room to pay with my credit card instead of paying by the bar. It as a bit odd.\n\nOther than these two aspects, we had an amazing time. The electronic dance music room DJ played awesome tracks and the hip hop room offered a completely different setting with additional great music. We stayed until close and even came back for Industry night the following Sunday night. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy Industry night as much as I did the night previous but overall, I would say that Muzique is a good place to go to if you want to dance with your friends. It was also spacious enough that I didn't feel cramped and uncomfortable. \n\nAs a side note, the stamps that we got both nights are still imprinted on my wrist and on my hand. Despite multiple attempts at scrubbing it off with soap and then rubbing alcohol and nail polish remover, the Muzique logo still remains.

Also, instead of saying \"Did you know your scalp is dry?\" and not giving me any suggestions to take care of it...something said like \"Hey, I notice that your scalp is dry. Something that might help is _________\" would be a little more helpful and probably a little more nice or what about when she said \"Your hair is falling out!\" How about, \"What kind of shampoo do you use?\" \"Well, this product might be a little more helpful in making your hair healthy and strong.\" \nOn a positive note, the color turned out great but im sure that there are plenty of other places I can go for great color that wont have me walking out self conscious about a dry scalp and hair falling out.", "stars": 2}

We had salads to start... Scott came by to take our plates and I was not completely finished with my salad.  He informed us our entrees were ready to be served.  Interesting so this salad must be taken?  I thought.  As he was so hastily ready to whisk away our salads, I realized he had taken away my knife with.  I asked, \"excuse me when you have a chance, may I please get a fresh knife?\"  He proceeded to bring back my half eaten salad and placed the plate in front of my face as if to say here, you can have this one.  \n\nAs we were nearly half way through our main dishes he had asked if either of us would want desert?  Now both my date and I are staring at each other and thinking, ok are we wasting this guys time or what?  We felt so rushed, so hurried to get out of there and just treated rudely.  My date, being the kind man he is said, you know what place a desert menu down and we will take a look at it when we are DONE with our entrees.  \n\nEntree dishes are taken, and do not get me wrong the food was delicious!  We are still finishing our wine and enjoying conversation... Scott had to have been back and forth at least 3 different times asking if we had made a decision.  At this point it is almost frustrating we just placed an order so this fellow would 1) leave us alone and 2) stop us feel as though we were wasting his time. \n\nIf you go here, I strongly encourage not sitting in Scott's section.

This time when I called, the rep understood my stance with not getting a tax increase charged in my statement. She removed it. She also helped lower my $60 charge for 6 months. I won't give Public Storage 5 stars because I continue to reject their drastic increases but in terms of listening to the complaints and reacting, I'll increase from 1 star to 3.\n\nI rented a 5x5 storage unit back in 2011 and was happy for the most part until last year. Suddenly, without warning they raised my fee from a total of $53 with taxes to $56 and change. I called to see what the reason was and they told me that they were increasing due to operational costs. I was astonished that they were transferring an almost 10% increase to every customer. They were also rather rude in answering my questions. I mean, \u00a8they're doing me the favor, right?\u00a8 Today I checked my statement and they increased my bill again to $60 and change. Calculating this, they have increased my bill from one year to another $4.30. Again, I called and it is because of operational costs. Online I see that they are offering units bigger than mine for $55. 1. try to control your \u00a8operational costs\u00a8 and don't hide that information from your current customers 2. have better customer service and retention programs...I asked what needed to be done so I could vacate my space and she didn't even try to keep my business DON'T GO HERE", "stars": 3}

{"text": "We came here on our wedding anniversary last year and decided to do the same this year with another couple.  I was so very disappointed.  Reservations got screwed up; I requested 7pm but they had me for 5pm.  (I think I had made my reservations online at around 5pm)  Not too big of a deal.  We waited at the bar, had a drink and appetizers.  It was nice of them to offer the first round of drinks on the house.  Bangin Shrimp and seared tuna were excellent; steamed mussels were fresh but because I prefer wine & garlic prep over their spicy broth, I didn't quite care for it.  We also were advised that they just recently had an ownership change.  'Gasp!!'  Different menu and some of the chefs had changed.  They no longer had their fantastic crab cakes in the appetizer list.  We had that last year and we were so looking forward to it!  \n\nIn retrospect, we should have left after drinks and appetizers.\n\nDinner was what ruined it all.  My friend's seared tuna dinner was not warm at all.  It appeared it was not served immediately and cooled off. Tuna, rice and veggies were all cool.  She had it taken back and they re-did it and they promptly served.\n\nMy husband's meal was pathetic.  He ordered the surf & turf which should have been alaskan crab legs and a 6 oz sirloin w/ white cheddar mashed potatoes.  1) This dish was also sitting out instead of being served immediately.  So naturally, nothing was warm including the mashed potatoes 2)  The sirloin was complete junk.  Three small bites of steak and the sirloin was done because the rest was fat and gristle.  They should be ashamed of serving that cut of meat on a sirloin plate because it should have been throw away meat.  3)  Alaskan crab?  I think not.  Let's say snow crab so naturally there was very little crab meat to pull out of it. He is typically not one to have a meal taken back and he didn't on this one either.   For $24, a complete waste.\n\nMy other friend had a burger and he was happy with his meal. I had the seared salmon dinner which must have been the last dish cooked before serving because my salmon was hot, although the rice and veggies were a little cool.\n\nOur waitress was pleasant but her attentiveness borders fair-poor.  It was a very long wait between drinks.  We had ordered more drinks (3 martini's and 1 beer) but neither of us had ONE drink throughout our dinner.  I mean, one of us had a bottle of beer, yet couldn't get that served?  We didn't even have iced water served until after our meal was served.  It may be more the bar at fault but I think the waitress shares some of that fault.\n\nAfter this experience, I highly doubt we will entertain dinner here again. I didn't like the menu and the meal itself was comparable to an Applebee's but certainly not the price of Applebee's!  Perhaps just a drink and appetizers but that's it.", "stars": 2}

We kept trying to flag down either our server or the manager when we wanted to pay to leave, but they just scanned the other three tables, then went back to wiping down the bar. \n\n-The wait staff are SUPER noobs. They don't really seem to have any idea how a dining room runs, or what serving professionallly looks like. I'm fine with casual, but this was awkward. The whole dining room seemed like it was being run by teens at their first jobs.\n\n-French fry salad was delicious, but veggie club was boring and awful.

Nothing spectacular. They do a full bag check getting in and you can't bring your own drinks in. The line took some time and there is no cover from the sun while waiting. I feel like i could go on about little things, but the one thing that made a return to The Flamingo a total deal breaker was the fact that not only did an employee knock on our door hours before checkout to wake us up to get out, but she proceeded to use her key to open the door  seconds later. What an unfortunate way to end the trip. \nLeaving this hotel, we are still unclear what time checkout is since every time we see contradicts one another, and aren't sure if a random charge is going to crop up since they don't make it clear what you are paying for in the beginning. \n\nWe still had a good trip and the location was ideal, but man, this hotel is not worth it for the money.", "stars": 2}
{"text": "I've been humming and hawing about writing this review for a couple of reasons I know people love this place and two I had super high expectations.\n\nWe went here for a birthday a couple of weeks ago. The chef at the other table was doing all sorts of tricks however ours was very boring and didn't really bring anything extra to the meal. I was totally hoping for some throwing and a little spice to the meal since I heard so many great things. However we got an onion volcano and some very dry jokes.\n\nI also find this place ridiculous for pricing. I know seafood is expensive but you can't honestly tell me I'm getting 7 pieces of cut up chicken for over $20 and a few prawns. I left feeling very hungry and I ended up stealing vegetables from other people who didn't want them. I just don't see the appeal. The steak sauce was also not my cup my tea that's just personal taste and I won't let it reflect on the rest.\n\nHonestly I found the guy who cleaned the grill after to be more entertaining. Everyone has always raved about this place and I can see the appeal but for me it just didn't cut it. I would have rather spent it on a steak dinner and left feeling full.\n\nThe decor was nice. However portions to price really bothered me. I felt cheated and they kept screwing up the drink orders. They also did not fix our bill due the errors not being one to cause a fuss (usually) we paid and left but I really could have used someone to go that extra mile to change my experience even a little bit.\n\nI may go back not sure how I feel about spending so much for a few pieces of chicken and few prawns. Could have been the chef we got I'm not really sure. The food did taste very good I just wanted more!", "stars": 3}

I really dislike having a film of oil on my lips. \n\nWe had a big group we had the dinner for 8. I thought everything was fairly average. I did not like the dumplings they were large in size but so oily. The salt and pepper squid was really salty and the squid tasted off. It tasted like bad fish to put it bluntly. I ate two pieces and refused to eat any more. \n\nI got a wicked headache. I'm pretty sensitive to food so I'm guessing it would guess it was something in the food maybe all the salt and oil my body is not used to. If I had to pick a \"favourite\" dish I would say the beef and broccoli was pretty good. I don't know if I would come back.

It was his only suit so we knew it had to get cleaned but no places are open on Sunday. We weren't about to go out and buy a new suit either.\n\nSo Monday morning I phoned around desperately trying to find a place that would take my boyfriend's suit and have it ready the next day in the morning. After phoning 2 other dry cleaners and getting some rude remarks I phoned coco's and was delighted when they said yes. It was a ten minute drive from home and when I saw how much they were going to clean the suit for I was elated!\n\nHowever when I went to pick up the suit in the morning I was told to come back at 5pm. I was a bit upset because I was told I could come by in the morning to get it so we didn't have to worry about packing things in at the last minute. 5 o'clock was cutting it close to the time we needed to be at the airport and I was not feeling to happy about doing errands with little time to spare.\n\nI would have preferred they phoned and told me they couldn't have the suit ready by the morning so I wasn't stuck driving back and forth. When I finally got the suit it was cleaned and pressed well. However when I took the suit out to pack into the luggage I found stains that were missed on the pants. Over all it will appear to be clean on photos which is what matters but since they sent me away to come back later I would have hoped they would have cleaned the suit a bit better.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "Let me start this review by saying I loved the venue but we kept running into problems and I began to lose faith. I feel really sad giving this rating because I have heard nothing but awesome things about Wurst, hopefully my next visit can change my mind. A few friends arrived around 7pm at Wurst to grab a table they were told that nothing would be available till around 10:30. So they put their names down for later and we killed some time at another venue close by.\n\n10:30 rolled around and we headed back to Wurst. I really wanted a good pint of beer and some dessert. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and he really wanted to go. We were told they had no idea what we were talking about when we told them we had names down for a group of 7. We spoke to many different staff members who all insisted there was no one on a list by the name we had given. After standing outside in the chilly night air for almost half an hour they let us go into the venue. I don't even know if it was figured out I just know I was happy to go inside the warm building.\n\nWe sat down at the table and began looking at the beer menus. The server came by and was in a fake polite mood. Smiling but rolling her eyes when someone asked her a question. (Sorry we didn't memorize the menu.) We had a fairly big group but we were organized and fun natured not rowdy. I could tell right away she was annoyed with our group. She took our orders so quickly she left before the other half of the table had a chance to utter a word and we tried to wave her over to come back since we weren't done but she did not return till some of our drinks came.\n\nAgain we ordered some food (the rest of our drinks) and were hoping to get some desserts. Two of our guests ordered a meal while the rest of us were craving something sweet. Again the waitress left before we could even ask her what they were offering for dessert. Finally we got her attention with one of my friends physically tapping her to turn around she came back very angry. Spit out the dessert offerings so fast we all looked at her as if she were speaking in tongues.\n\nI split the apple crisp with my significant other. It wasn't my favourite I felt I could have done a better job making it from scratch at home. Maybe it was the bad taste left in my mouth from our server though. The beer I ordered however was awesome. I love dark beer and I think I could have enjoyed almost every single beer on the list.\n\nI really did love this venue. The upstairs was cozy and fun and the basement was a riot I felt like I was back in Europe I felt very at home. However I was not impressed with the service. Everyone in our group picked up on her attitude and yes I do feel bad if she was going through some tough things however I have worked in the service industry for four years and have always kept my cool in front of my customers (even when they were screaming in my face).\n\nAlthough we were a big group and I understand they can be tough to handle we didn't like feeling so rushed and we clearly were a burden to our server which was reflected strongly when it came to paying our tab. I would go back to Wurst again I just hope when it comes to eating a meal there I don't have to feel like I'm competing in a 100 yard dash to place my order.", "stars": 3}

{"text": "Being a girl who loves red meat the Keg is my go to for quality and consistency. We went to have a nice celebratory dinner and all I can say is I'm very disappointed. I always get the same dish at the Keg the prime rib. I mean my grandma makes a crazy good prime rib but for eating out the keg never disappoints me with their prime rib. \n\nHowever this time I was not a fan of the meal at all. The prime rib I ordered was supposed to be a Medium it was far from that mostly over cooked. Lacked any sort of flavour and the size I asked for seemed much smaller than what I'm used to. I also ordered a skewer of jumbo prawns. I always eat my prawns first because they are my favourite and although they were cooked properly they were cold for something that was \"hot\" off the grill. I like my food hot simple as that.\n\nThe layout of the dining room is really bizarre. You are seated next to people who are practically eating their dinner with you. Not the greatest setting to have a nice meal out and conversation. I would have rather we ate our meal in the lounge which had better seating and it was actually more intimate for a conversation and meal. (Had I known this at the time of course)\n\nThe wine list is great however over priced for sure. I could bring my own bottle if I really wanted to fork out so much money for a basic generic wine. The service was really good though I always find the staff at any Keg really friendly and helpful. I'm over the Keg for the time being though.

The only problem was this Calgary based company (Routine) only offered their product in a few locations so when I saw that Blush Lane was carrying it and I was going to be in the vicinity I was so happy!\n\nNot only did they have a ton of (Routine Cream) they had tons of other things to buy as well. The store is really small and it's kind of crammed. I found it really over whelming because your in groceries and you turn the corner and your in a completely new section.\n\nThey have manuka honey for $23 I just paid $30 at my health food store! They carry all the vitamins I love for much cheaper too so I have to remember this for the future! I also saw a great selection of food here I only looked at some of the products as I was getting stir crazy, Lots of different lactose free cheese!!! Will also have to remember this.\n\nThe lady who helped me find what I was looking for in the first place was super sweet. The girls at the cash out were a bit annoying. Talking to one another was more important than customers, and nobody knew who was going to take me as their customer at both open tills. I went back and forth and finally put my things down as I was getting irritated by the unnecessary confusion. They also asked me if I was a blush lane member..

The mushrooms were delicious.  The wings were kind of dry.  My husband loved his pizza.  Next week, we got it delivered.  Any place that delivers to the base gets a bonus point.  This time we ordered spicy buffalo pizza, bacon cheeseburger, and baklava.  Once again the pizza was delicious.  The burger was huge but didn't have a lot of seasoning to it and was kind of dry.  The baklava just tasted really greasy and bitter.  Over all, the place is decent for the price and the portions are pretty big.", "stars": 3}

The lady was very polite and answered all our questions.  We have been to Korea and this place had some of the best kimchi we have tasted in Las Vegas.  The bulgogi and dumplings were pretty good, too.  The portions were huge!  It was enough to feed 4 people.

The flavour is not quite right and we were really thirsty after eating it. \n\nSecond time, we tried the crab, the recommended one year old kimchi soup, and seafood tofu soup. The crab was quite expansive and it was not worth it. If I remember it right, it was almost $20 for three or four really small crabs. The crabs were raw and seasoned with soy sauce and left in the sauce for around a week. The taste is not good and is clearly overpriced. The seafood soup had almost no seafood. The one year old kimchi sounds good but it is much worse than the regular kimchi, it was very sour and it was chewy, not crunchy at all. \n\nAlso, this place is more expensive than many other Korean restaurants I have been to.

And the flavor of the steak's on point: subtly spiced without being overpowering. \n\nThe roasted chili corn salsa's decent as well. It's not quite bursting with flavor but nevertheless adds an extra layer of interest to your burrito.

They aren't worth the price at all. And everything else too seems a tad overpriced at Chipotle considering its food quality and taste.\n\nFrankly, Maize, only about a 5 minutes walk from Chipotle, easily gives the latter a run for its money. Maize's food tastes considerably more wholesome despite being actually cheaper than Chipotle and you get a small serving of complimentary chips and salsa with your meal. Oh, and Maize's chips are in a league of their own!\n\nEven Guy Fieri came all the way to Champaign to try Maize.

In fact, Bombay Indian Grill on First Street, Champaign had better ambiance and a superior buffet selection at about the same price but it closed down, leaving Ambar the only Indian buffet in town. \n\nFood's hit or miss here. Chicken pakora starter isn't always part of the spread but it tastes good. Tikka masala's perfectly fine but the tough and almost flavorless tandoori chicken's nothing to write home about. Ditto for lamb curry, which was essentially chewy meat in a generic brown sauce. \n\nNaan bread's always lukewarm. However, the bhatura bread they had as part of a rather nice Mother's Day buffet spread a couple of years ago, although very calorific, wasn't bad at all. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for some of the other rotating items. \"Hara bhara kabob\" was drenched in a disturbing green food color--and, on top of that, had little flavor to speak of. Chilli chicken was inexcusably bad. \n\nPlain rice's alright. Other rice dishes usually are not.

That said it's still quite an improvement from the atrocious quick service Chinese restaurant that used to be located nearby at the Illini Union food court.  \n\nThe 'classic' Panda Express entrees, Orange Chicken and Beijing Beef, taste alright individually but collectively both score high on the saccharine sweet index.

After 25 minutes, I never received a callback. So I called again; a gentlemen named Steve answered, then called me back and said \"They should be there shortly.\"- Not even a \"Sorry?\"\nThe installer final showed up at 1pm. I am still here waiting for him to finish 6 hours later after waiting. \nThis was not what I was expecting after spending $1,300 on one room.

I feel weird writing this, because it's kind of a personal experience, you're inviting someone into your home, so the feeling of disappointment and how to rectify it is much more uncomfortable to fix than a confrontation over an incorrect coffee order. \n\nThe woman who came to my house seemed really sweet and she had polite manners and was easy to talk to. I will say that I liked her. \n\nI feel guilty writing a negative review because I got to know her and she seemed kind and fairly cool. And she is, human error exists and everything can't be perfect. \n\nAnyway, I was there for an hour and a half of it and I  decided to step out because I felt that my presence may be distracting for a house cleaner since they have to keep up with small talk while trying to focus on a task. I left for 2+ hours so they could really focus on the task at hand and pay attention to detail.

I asked about it and she said she couldn't get it off and tried using a *insert scrubber brand here* and it still didn't work. I figured whatever, I'll just get it later if it's so stubborn. The kitchen floor was mopped and still wet so I just glanced over and everything looked fine. On a walk through, the house looked fine. I told her it looked fine and she could leave. \n\nI wasn't blown away, it looked to be about the same amount of time it would take me to complete that level of house work. It's just that, I hired a professional so I was hoping it would be really well done. Once the kitchen floor dried (she had left) I looked again and sat on the floor to inspect, there were crumbs everywhere on the floor. I know it had been swept because not all the crumbs were still on the floor. But, not thoroughly at all, not enough to constitute a full clean. Crumbs all over the corners and in the center of the kitchen floor. I bought a full clean and it included exterior appliances. She wiped my fridge but at a second look there was lint all over the edge of it. The door of my oven wasn't even touched. My microwave exterior wasn't cleaned.... Dishes are included in a full clean and mine were still in the sink (just two cups). The sink wasn't cleaned. Chrome fixtures still had residue on them. Mirrors still had what looked like make up on them. I went back over to where the dried on pancake batter was and lightly scratched it with my fingernail and it came off so easily, same with the make up, and the sink's chrome. The light fixtures in my bathroom still had visible dust on them. My windowsill in the kitchen wasn't even quickly wiped over. You get the point. It wasn't all bad, there were things I was happy with, the bedroom carpet being vacuumed and the bed being made was great. The bedroom looked great. I also felt comfortable with her being there. \n\nAll in all, there were 9 things on the Hux checklist that weren't completed or even done. It wasn't a full clean at all and I left feeling kind of disheartened and definitely disappointed. I'm not willing to single out the person who came to clean my house as they are only a reflection of Hux and the competitive standard they have of hiring the top 6%. I am a reasonable easing going person, but there were way too many disappointments for me to recommend this service or be quick to re-book.", "stars": 2}

She was gone for quite some time so we committed a retail \"no-no\" and took the skirt off the mannequin. I got another skirt (same style/size, different color) to replace it. Associate came back, saw what we did, left again. When the Manager came up, he immediately SCOLDED us like children (not exaggerating), grabbed the skirt from us, and did not take a second to explain anything before we could say a word. Turns out they do a \"Hold\" for the item but you can't buy it that day. We were definitely upset by the Manager's approach and decided that we didn't want to spend our money at a store with a manager like that.

If you're local and plan to stay local, I highly recommend. \n\nHowever, in December of 2012 my parents got a certified letter saying I failed to keep my follow up appointment (which I never made) to check on my diagnosis of dysplasia. Uhm WHAT? I assumed my results were normal since I heard nothing for a year and a half. When I called to figure out what on earth happened, I found out that my results were abnormal. When I didn't come back in July of 2012 (because I moved to Boston) it flagged them to follow up with me. I guess that took 6 months because the letter came when I was home for Christmas. \n\nSo not only was the letter misleading (it insinuated I was pre-cancerous when I was not) and my results were not communicated with me, but on top of that the nurse I spoke to was outrageously rude to me. She seemed annoyed with me for being worked up about the letter and tried to intimate that it was my fault for not coming back in July 2012. She didn't seem to understand that I had no knowledge of the abnormal results or why I would be upset about a certified letter saying I could get cancer if I continue to ignore this diagnosis. \n\nNow my blood tests are exhibiting discrepancies consistent with some leukemias and I remembered this. I called the office again to ask about my medical records (the receptionist was very helpful and great!) and to have someone call me back to refresh my memory on my abnormal results. Once again, the nurse's attitude was inexcusable. She started interrogating me on my follow up care, asking why I hadn't been back since 2011 and why I thought I had two, normal results consecutively if I didn't. I had to once again explain that her office didn't notify me until DECEMBER 2012 and my last pap was in JULY 2012. \n\nLast, and this is the best part, she started questioning my current sexual information (Do you have a boyfriend? Do you use condoms?). I felt it was highly inappropriate, not least of all because I don't know actually who I'm speaking with. I'm still not entirely clear on how someone can be so rude to a scared patient, and I don't understand their follow up policies at all. Long review, but I felt strongly enough that I wanted to post.", "stars": 2}

I inquired about getting a room with two queen beds and you would have thought I asked to speak with the president himself.  She gave me a lot of attitude about how she would have to check and see (sounds easy right), but she seemed so upset over checking that.  Nonetheless she did get me a room with 2 queens.  I was going to ask for an upgrade but after that experience I was just glad to get 2 queens and still be alive.  When I walked into the room I was at first fascinated with the technology that comes with the room (electronic curtains and lights, etc) but it didnt take long for me to realize they went cheap on it.  The clock is also a remote with a giagantic cable hooked to the wall.  At best the clock remote works 45% of the time.  Our TV broke the second day there and had to be fixed.  Its fancy technology on the cheap...real cheap.\n\nMy biggest complaint by far was the window washers at 7:45am.  There I was trying to sleep on my vacation day, heaven forbid, and all of the sudden I thought King Kong was scaling the building.  I investigated the noise and saw two guys washing the windows, blairing music.  This happened the next day as well.  I complained and a $50 credit was \"given.\"  I went to dinner at Julie Serrano, which was an OK place for tapas.  The bill was charged to the room with intent to use the $50 credit.  When I checked out the $50 credit was not given.  I went to the lobby and spoke with a desk clerk.  I explained all the problems I experienced during my stay and asked if she could credit the entire dinner bill, which was $92.00.  She said ok, then credited $50 to the bill.  I said, \"I thought you were going to credit the entire bill,\" and she responded, \"No,\" then handed me the receipt.  At that point I just wanted to leave the place and never return.  I dont recommend this place at all. They should be ashamed of their service.", "stars": 2}
{"text": "Worst experience ever! What a nightmare \n\nWhile waiting at the gate in Las Vegas, a representative announced that there is a mechanical failure on the aircraft and crews were working on fixing the problem, \"but there is a chance that this plane isn't going anywhere.\" I then overheard Allegiant employees discussing how 5 other planes had mechanical failures that day. \n\nAfter being delayed for 2hrs, we were told the problem was fixed and we would be boarding the plane. We boarded the aircraft and then were told that a new problem had came up and they would be fixing it. To apologize for the inconvenience, the crew passed out water (how generous of them...water). After waiting on the plane for almost an hour, we were told this plane was still broken and we had to get off the plane and wait for another one(which was coming from Colorado). Eventually we got on a plane and I reached my destination. They get 2 stars because they got me from point A to point B. \n\nAllegiant is an extremely cheap airline. The ticket clerk is also the luggage handler, gate clerk, and ground control. It was almost funny to watch how cheap this company is, but then again so was the ticket. When it comes to this airline you truly get what you pay for. You pay next to nothing and you get next to nothing. The planes are horribly maintained. They fly MD-80's which has a total of 17 fatal events (where the aircraft flight had a direct or indirect role, excludes hijacks, etc) from 1981-2008. \n\nYou can really tell they keep overheard costs to a bare minimum. Even the employees joke about how cheap the company is. When the plane broke and when we had to deplane after being told the plane was fixed, flight attendants and gate clerks had the attitude of \"nothing new.\" If you don't care about service, safety, and convenience then this company is fine. Personally I would rather spend the extra hundred bucks or so and fly on a more reputable airline.", "stars": 2}

When we checked in we were told we had to pay a daily $28 resort fee on top of the room fee. It included limited wifi and we had no choice so we didn't argue. When we got to our room in the Palace Tower it was ok but a bit shabby looking. We noticed a coffee machine and thought at least we can have a cup in the AM before looking for a reasonable breakfast place, but it was not to be. They charge $13 for 4 K cups and had no free options. We have traveled all over the US and the world and never saw that. A bit annoyed, we visited Walgreens and purchased instant coffee, juice and milk as well as some pastries. We thought \"problem solved\" until our check out. They charged us $25 for using the space in the minibar for our juice and milk, claiming it was not a refrigerator and they said there was a sign saying that. Guess what, no sign that we saw. We argued and were told they would \"investigate\" our claim. Since we had to catch a plane we couldn't pursue it and I'm fairly certain we will never receive our $25 back. Ridiculous way to treat customers/guests! We will never go back and if anyone asks us about LV accommodations we will tell them to stay away. Very unsatisfied.

{"text": "Initially, from the reviews this sounded like a great place to to, so a friend decided to join me on this culinary journey to Markham. \n\nWe arrived early for dinner, no-one was there, we then started to review the buffet, and the first thing you notice that's not acceptable,  was the food was just warm, not hot. Makes you feel it's the lunch offering transformed into dinner. However, there was a modest amount of dishes to choose from, including buttered chicken, and a mysterious curried chicken. You have to wonder what kind of curried chicken are you offering? non-descript and unpleasant.  Perhaps offering kormas, madras,  or vindaloo curries would have stirred my interest.\n\nThere were cold pakoras, I did try one, but it lacked freshness. The key to great Indian cooking is fresh ingredients,  quickly cooked in ghee or mustard oil, and onions well cooked until they are brown, and a garlic/ginger paste for additional flavour. This gives the base for curries then you add curry leaves and your assortment of spices. Since this is a lunch/dinner buffet, It's more cafeteria style than anything else.\n\nNan was brought to the table, it was okay. Overall, this doesn't cut it in any way as an authentic Indian offering, but if you like cafeteria style food you can eat your heart out", "stars": 2}
{"text": "This is an update to my previous review where I had the chance to learn more about the restaurant,  that gave me a better perspective, as well I sampled the dinner menu.\n\nI had ordered chicken satay as one of the starters, and found the satay to be so incredibly mild I had to call our server over and enquire. Satay should have a spicy bite with a healthy heat and I asked why this was so mild. I was told they tamed the Thai dishes down because this was  family restaurant,  and kids would not be able to eat food with traditional spiciness. \n\nGood point! that helped me position the review a little better. The chicken on the Chicken satay, was lacking flavor, lots of chicken but very bland. We also ordered the Thai chicken wings, good size but again pretty bland.\n\nMy friend ordered the Pad Thai,  that's not a tough dish to cook, I ordered the Chicken Penang with chicken fried rice. It wasn't bad, again, I have to look past the authenticity and settle for family rated food. So, that being said, you certainly get lots, and the service although very busy, our service was excellent and thoughtful.\n\nIt was suggested I try the coconut ice. A whole, small coconut imported from Asia, with coconut in a coconut milk/cream concoction that was delicious, I highly recommend this.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for plenty of family type Thai food with lots of leftovers,  great service and modest prices, this is for you!", "stars": 3}

On top of that, our meal for four people was over $100 - way too expensive for the quality of food we were served. The only things that tasted decent were the Oktoberfest specials, and we ended up having to take most of our food to go because it had taken so long to come out.", "stars": 2}
{"text": "I was excited to be staying at this Marriott location and decided to take advantage of the spa for a couple of services during that time. I decided on a Quench Pedicure followed by a Coconut Sugar Glow (80 minute with massage). \n\nFirst impressions: I decided to head down about an hour or so before my treatments to enjoy the spa a bit beforehand. I checked in and was taken in to get my shoes and robe and place my things in a locker. I checked out the spa area and decided to read my book in the area near the cold/hot dunk pools. The fruit infused water they had on hand was very refreshing and I relaxed and read for a bit. Unfortunately the weekend I was in Vegas was the rainiest/coldest they had had in awhile so I did not get to try the pool area outside (though I really wanted to!) One thing I noticed that didn't go away, if anything was more noticeable, was that there was a stale smoke smell in the spa. The casino is right out the doors and obviously the ventilation system is not the best since it was apparent even within the confines of Spa Aquae. \n\nPedicure: My pedicurist was very sweet and we had a lovely conversation. She wasn't as thorough with my feet as I would have liked, but they looked pretty when she was finished. One thing I did notice (and it ended up being a problem) is that they don't really have an area/equipment to stick your feet to dry the toes. She fanned at my toes with a set of salon flip flops but they weren't completely dry for my next treatment in 15 minutes. The problem came when I laid face down on the massage table, my big toes ended up getting smudged big time (which I didn't notice until I was getting redressed in the locker room). For the price, that was disappointing. \n\nSugar Glow/Massage: This service was amazing and worth every penny. My skin felt so soft afterwards and the massage done at the end confirmed my new identity as butter. The facilities were dimly lit and the table comfortable. The shower that I had to use to rinse off the sugar could definitely use an update (broken tiles, etc). I would have this service completed again in the future as it was a nice alternative to a traditional massage. \n\nOverall experience: Am I happy I had some \"me\" time at the spa? Of course. Would I return to this location and pay the prices listed? (I had a discount with the group I was with): No. I would research and find another spa in town. The stale smoky smell that permeated the spa areas was also troublesome because let's face it, it's the last thing you want lingering in the air when you're trying to relax.", "stars": 3}

There were four of us and we tried the four course tasting menu which was a really nice variety of food for the price. Since there were four of us we each got a different dish per course, giving us the chance to try many menu items. We started with the mushroom flatbread that was not the most flavorful. We had four different salads which looked lovely but the dressings needed more seasoning. We had the golden squash soup which was lovely but also could have used a bit more seasoning, loved the homemade marshmallow on top! We had the lamb, the beef sirloin, the walu and the roasted chicken as our entree course.  The chicken was the clear winner, it was tender and delicious. Out of all our desserts the chocolate pana cotta was melt in your mouth chocolate deliciousness and the brownies were not far behind. Overall good value for all the dishes you get to try.

{"text": "My husband and I stayed here last weekend for a much-needed Vegas getaway. \n\nThe particular room we stayed in was alright...\"A-OK\" as my 3-star rating can attest, but honestly? Despite the additional kitchen sink and wine glasses in the cabinets, our room in particular wasn't any more special than a Hampton or Garden Inn. Maybe I'm spoiled by suites at the likes of the Venetian when I travel to Vegas. They're clean and comfortable, and if the price is right...as everyone says, you don't really spend all that much time in the room anyway in Vegas, right? Least you're not likely to find a dead hooker in your mattress or anything. \n\nIt's also kind of far from the action of the strip, located essentially across from the Sahara and a good few blocks from the Stratosphere. While I'm not a high-rollin' Vegas snob in the least, keep this in mind if this is your first time in Vegas. No casino and no crazy cigarette smell, which is nice, depending on your preference. \n\nHilton Grand Vacations definitely has perks...a 24-hr. convenience shop if you want a late-night sandwich or want to split a bottle of post-cocktail champagne or wine with your sweetie. Nice exercise room. There's also a cool rec room with foozball and such if you're stuck here for a business meeting or what have you. \n\nSeems like the perks are better if you're a time share owner here. I'm a measly Hilton Silver member so that's probably why I got an \"eh\" room. \n\nI'm also going to be honest and knock off an additional star for the constant barrage of phone calls I received booking AND staying at this place. I was called at least once a day on my cell prior to arrival (whilst playing phone tag...I'm somewhat respectful and try to return all calls) to \"ensure check-in was smooth\", which basically translated to me as \"Purchase our time share plan!\" \n\nThey will also call your room once a day to try to sell their time shares on to you (loud phone ringing in your room in Vegas is always kind of startling, especially when you're trying to sleep off that last 4am cocktail...)\n\nI'd recommend this place if you're already over the hooplah of the Vegas strip and want a somewhat-inbetween getaway.

Suffice it to say, it failed.  \n\nOne thing I like about Z-Teca is the atmosphere. In comparison to Burrito Boyz, Z-Teca provides a fairly mellow, stress-free place to eat. The interior is clean and sleek. Typically the playlist is also all right. \n\nAs for why Z-Teca couldn't win me over... \n\n1. Z-Teca is incredibly stingy with its burrito toppings. Not just with the meat, but also with its beans and veges. Unlike at Burrito Boyz or other competitors where the cost gets you your choice of toppings, Z-Teca charges you extra for just about everything, despite the above-average cost of the one-size-for-all burritos and salads. Even the onion/green peppers cost extra. Guacamole is $1.25 or so. One can easily pay $12 for their burrito if they want all the toppings - this is for a burrito that even with the works, is not as many ounces as a large $8-$10 burrito from Burrito Boyz. \n2. Another major setback is the customer service. Staff always appears angry and aloof. When I've politely asked for a premium topping, I get a curt reply that it'll cost extra, as though they don't want me to have it. Any request for an additional topping is made to seem like an inconvenience to the staff member. Aren't I paying extra anyway? \n3. Onions, onions, onions. It seems that everything is tinged with onions in order to compensate for the blandness of the meat and other toppings. \n4. Not once have I had my appetite fully quenched from one of Z-Teca's burritos. I've tried the chicken, the shrimp, and the vegetable burrito, none of which filled me up to satisfaction. Once I decided to order some chips so that I might feel more full, but was provided with only the tiniest container of salsa to dip them into. The container is so small that I had to break each chip in half to be able to dip it in. Naturally, an additional tiny container of salsa comes at a cost. The tiny container only provided enough salsa for about 4 chips - the chips are too plain to eat on their own, so I ultimately gave them to a homeless person. \n\nZ-Teca will likely be around for a while regardless of if it makes improvements simply on account of the convenient location. The establishment will forever live in the shadows of its competitors though in a neighborhood full of superior burrito stops.", "stars": 2}

She did a hell of a lot better job then I could ever do with a dark colour so it's not the biggest issue for me. \n\nThe shellac manicure was $30.

{"text": "I was here tonight for a first date. My date and I split 3 appetizers: the Pickerel Tostada, Smoked Chili Tiger Prawns, and Sweet Potato Fries. \n\nThe Pickerel Tostada was rich with flavour and ingredients and was my favourite of the bunch but the Smoked Chili Tiger Prawns were a close second. The actual prawns themselves were excellently seasoned and tasted amazing with the spiced honey and tomato cilantro vinaigrette sauce but the lentil quenelle that came with it left something to be desired for me. Perhaps if you get a really good dollop of the spiced honey sauce on the quenelle the flavours improve but eating the lentil quenelle alone left a bland almost cardboard like taste. I think the key is to get some of everything on the fork and then maybe the flavours and consistencies blend nicely together. The plate would have satisfied me much more had it been all prawns and sauce no lentil. The Sweet Potato fries were ante'd up a notch with a dip I'd never had with sweet potato fries before. Unfortunately it's not described on the menu and I didn't think to ask the waiter but it tasted almost like a ranch and blue cheese combination with what looked like green onion mixed it. It was delicious and a welcome change from the traditional chipotle mayo sauce we're all used to. \n\nNot sure if management pushes the staff to get people in an out ASAP but our waiter brought us our bills while our plates were only half eaten (we had been there maybe 30 minutes) and came back ten minutes later and grabbed our plates (which still had food on them) in a manner that lead me to believe our time was up. He did ask before he walked away with the plates but when the waiter's hand is possessively holding your plate and then they ask you if you're done you say \"Yes master! Sorry master for being so slow\". This as I said was with food still on the plates AND half consumed beverages. I left that restaurant having not finished my cider; a feat that I assure you has never occurred before. \n\nIt was nowhere near closing time and it was a Monday night. \n\nThough hustled out the evening was enjoyable and we went on to a pub nearby for more drinks. Had we not been rushed, the restaurant would of got at least one maybe two more rounds out of us. \n\nI'd go back but I won't be hurried out like that again.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "I joined this gym in January because I moved to the neighbourhood. I was coming from Fit 4 Less so I had low expectations. \n\nI like that this gym has a women's only workout area and that they offer a variety of classes. I'd also say that its a fairly clean gym and in my average 1-2 hour workout I usually see the cleaning lady several times going around the gym and locker room sweeping up and picking up used paper towel off the floor. \n\nThe gym has a play room for kids and have day care hours for parents who want to get in a workout but have their kid with them. Call to check their day care hours though because the other day a man was turned away with his young daughter because he'd gotten the times wrong and the day care wasn't open.\n\nOccasionally they do not have an adequate amount of free weights in the women's only area but I borrow some from the stretching area and bring them back when I'm done.\n\nOne thing that always grosses me out about the gym though is it has pretty poor ventilation (I mean it is in a basement) and so you can often see liquid dripping from the ceiling and coating the walls and I'm certain it is not just water from the showers... the walls are sweaty. \n\nThey were pretty good to me when I lost my job and I had to cancel the personal training I had signed up for before my first session and I was thankful for that. \n\nThe perfect time to sign up is a month or so before the new year because they slash their monthly prices to entice people to join. If you join shortly after January you'll be paying a pretty penny. \n\nI think the gym could use a face lift, some fresh paint and maybe try and figure out the ventilation issues but overall a gym that has everything I need.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "I was here last weekend for dinner. I split the London Porker (pulled pork sandwich) and chicken wings with my sister. The chicken wings were fine; a good size and an adequate amount of honey garlic sauce. The sandwich however was very disappointing. Seriously, DO NOT order this sandwich unless you really really like an overpowering taste of horseradish. \n\nThe sandwich had pulled pork, peameal bacon, coleslaw, mustard and horseradish sauce but you wouldn't have know the sandwich consisted of anything but horseradish. It was burning my throat it was so strong a flavour. Why ruin pulled pork with horseradish? In my opinion all you need to make a good pulled pork sandwich is the bread, the pulled pork with a sweet BBQ sauce and some cheese. They were clearly trying to class this pulled pork up and fell very short. I couldn't taste the flavour of meat at all, I'm telling you it was 100% horseradish! \n\nMy sister who shared the sandwich with me and my date who tried a bite agreed. \n\nLet's be honest, I wasn't really trying this place out for the food. They have a pretty sweet patio I'd been meaning to try. The patio didn't disappoint but I wouldn't race back for the food and I will not be ordering the London Porker sandwich again. \n\nOverall a cool atmosphere with a Union Jack explosion of decor and a nice patio.

The food is great and that's why I come back, but one incident happened tonight that completely changed my perception about this place. I had just finished eating dinner with a special someone and asked if they wanted to go to luv it for dessert. I did know that they were to close at 10pm, but since it was 945, I knew I would be able to make it before they closed. Just in case, I called and let them know I was on my way and that I was coming from across town, but I was already over halfway there. They said as long as I'm there before 10pm, they would still serve me. \n\nAs I was about to pull in, I called again. They said that they were closing in 2 min. I literarily had just parked when the lady hung up on me. Once I went up to the window, it was still 9:58pm , and they had the closed sign out and the drapes over the windows. I knocked on the window and no one was answering as I saw them just waiting in the building.\n\nI can't believe they not only hung up as I pulled in, but they closed early, refused service to the same person that called twice and that they said would serve if I was there before 10pm.\n\nCompletely disrespectful service and a waste of gas.

{"text": "Honestly, I wasn't impressed. The place itself is nice: the patio is gay boi heaven with lots of seating in the summer for people watchin'. There was a sufficient smattering of hunks in tanks and their older followers. I think that is the main draw here: the patio. It seems like the inside is very 'meh,' your typical converted Victorian home with the standard modern decor. My boyfriend and I went for Summerlicious and truthfully the food was good. I started with the caprese stack, had the streak frites for my main, and finished with the brownie. The price for the fixed menu itself seemed reasonable: $35. But seriously those portions were TINY. I mean the 'stack' literally had maybe 6 leaves. I mean, really!? Do I look like a bird? I need to EAT mofos. So while what was on the plate was tasty, there really wasn't much of it.  The steak was FATTY like, that's not ok. And the piece of meat was small. I understand that us Canadians may be used to big pieces of red meat, some the size of your arm, but this was just SMALL. \n\nThe host was a nice enough guy but our Australian waiter was so abrupt. I mean like he was a bitchy queen. I saw him ordering around the bus boys, and demeaning the other staff. I mean, lighten up ol' boy. And while this is a relatively minor point I noticed that almost EVERY table they brought the wrong food to the wrong person. We were approached twice with someone else's food. None of the waiters deliver the food to their tables: they have the kitchen staff do this. And it seems they don't even tell them which table its supposed to go to because they just wander around aimlessly asking 'steak frites, anyone steak frites.' Like that is sosososo 'Applebee's' of them.\n\nThe bill was $140. I KNOW. FOR TWO PEOPLE. I really find that over-priced, especially considering it was during SUMMERLICIOUS! Like, it's supposed to be cheap. Only cheap bitches go out during summerlicious. The pitcher of sangria was $39!!! Honestly the one thing that is really really overpriced here is the liquor.

{"text": "It is what it is: all-you-can-eat sushi in downtown Montreal. I mean if you're from Vancouver you'll probably think its like the worst sushi experience ever but for us Eastern Canadians who just like to gorge ourselves with spicy salmon rolls it does the trick. My boyfriend and I love sushi--we're regular sushi whores--so we absolutely love AYCE just because we can order as much as we want! Our order is usually the same: two miso soups, a green salad, chicken teriyaki, 20 or so salmon roses, 3 orders of spicy salmon, a Philadelphia roll, maybe a Dynamite (if the tempura is fresh), vegetable tempura, and green tea ice cream to top it all off. We've got it down to a science--even memorizing the menu item numbers you write down on those little pieces of paper! But its definitely not the best. I would stick to the rolls here if I were you, they're dependable. I've had the actual sushi and its not bad but the quality of the fish is definitely not grade-A. The service is better here at Sushi Crescent versus Tokyo Sushi--further along Ste-Catherine towards Concordia--where it is absolutely terrible! Terrible! Here it is marginally better, but again pretty bad. You have to be very forceful, hand them you're order directly (don't wait for them to come to take it). They might try and stick you with stuff you didn't order but tell them right away you actually didn't and they'll take it back. I have a theory, they want you to pay extra for uneaten sushi! Evil they are I tell you, ha! \n\nThe location is pretty nice actually. I seem to remember that it used to be a bar or lounge and the new owners have kept much of the same interior but added a sushi-prep area both upstairs and down. You might have to wait on weekends as it does fill up fast. Also, they jacked up the price recently. Which was a real piss off. It used to be $15 each and now its like $21 after taxes but before tip.

{"text": "This place is definitely mediocre and I agree with all the reviews  that deem this little hole in the wall 'overpriced,' because it really is. I ventured over to this spot last night for a quick bite to eat--I was craving spicy salmon rolls like you wouldn't even believe--and I left feeling unsatisfied. Firstly, $6.75 for a spicy salmon roll (with 5 dinky pieces) is really unacceptable. I mean I don't even think it was made fresh and it was not (I repeat, not) spicy in the least bit. Although I must admit the Chicken teriyaki was good--fresh vegetables, delicious sauce--I feel that you could get the same thing at a food court in a mall somewhere. Hell, even 'Teriyaki experience' at Centre Eaton serves up a good teriyaki stir-fry.\n\nThe service was bizarre. The waitress did not speak a word to me--from the moment I  walked in (she motioned me to an open table) to the time I left, it was mostly grunts and head nodding. I usually go out of my way to say 'oh, thanks' or 'how are you,' but it would have been like talking to a brick wall with this one. She was a piece of work. \n\nThe decore is very mundane. Its basically like title flooring with a splash of this nasty blue paint on the walls. The tables are wobbly and the chairs are IKEA. Nothing wrong with IKEA but for $25 for one roll and a teriyaki I expect at least a little effort on presentation. I should've known--if there are only two other diners in the joint at 6 pm its probably not where you want to spend your precious sushi dollars. \n\nEven Sushi Crescent--an AYCE place--was infinitely better in taste, price, and quantity.

{"text": "Ginger is definitely one of the better sushi restaurants in Montreal. Many people are completely enamoured with this place  and sing its praises every chance they get. I like it, but it don't think its the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. To begin, the place is fancy and ultra-modern in design; its not the typical faux-Asian design. It is Asian fusion modern which suits the place well considering it is a Japanese-fusion restaurant. The crowd is decidedly Montreal chic--yuppies, students, older Montrealers with some money to spend--and the prices reflect the audience. They offer fresh and MASSIVE rolls (usually 5 piece in a roll). This place is not cheap. Rolls are typically $12+ and entrees are not less than $20+ each. Miso soup, while large and chalked full of tofu, is $8. Ok ok doesn't sound THAT expensive but I'm used to cheaper rolls in Toronto/Vancouver and am always astounded by what Montreal restos charge for sushi, especially when you're only getting five pieces. I've lived here for five years and am still bothered by the price discrepancy. Having said that, the quality of the rolls are on the mark. They're probably about the size of 8 regular sized rolls, so fear not you hungry foodies! The alcohol is way over priced so be aware of that before ordering a round of drinks. \n\nI had the 'dynamite roll' which was pretty bad actually--clearly not a speciality of Ginger. But my friends (who are regulars) introduced me to some of the other rolls which were far superior in quality and taste. This is clearly a place where you can't order your 'regular order,' you have to go out on a limb and order one of the fancy, totally original, and totally un-authentic rolls. This is what I like to call 'white people sushi' but of high-grade and in a beautiful environs. Nothing wrong with that but be prepared for lots of mayo, cream cheese, cooked fish, etc. etc. \n\nAlso the service needs work. Gurrrl, like a lot of work. I was brought my sushi and than had to wait 10 minutes for the rest of the rolls of my fellow diners to arrive. And then they proceeded to 'lose' my order for teriyaki. And than they had to wait for me to get my entree. I mean this is restaurant etiquette 101: serve all diners at once. And they were really unapologetic about the whole situation. I understand well-crafted food takes time but at least hold the orders until they're all ready and don't make me stare at my food longingly waiting for the others to be served. Be prepared to wait over an hour for your food--at least--on a friday. They usually have 1-2 servers working the room and the kitchen is clearly also understaffed. \n\nAll in all a good alternative to the generally awful sushi restaurants in Montreal but the service is bad, and the food is overpriced. A nice night out nonetheless.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "Ohhhhh Saint-Sulpice. What I like to call my 'first-year' stomping ground. This place is a university bar mixed with St-Denis chic with a little trashy Quebecois-ness thrown in for good measure. This place has the largest patio EVER, its really quite grotesque (in the best way possible) and its always teeming with people in the summer. It makes for the perfect place to sit on a hot summer's night and refresh with a pitcher or a pint. The inside itself is equally massive. The facade is deceptive, you think 'oh that looks like a cute little bar,' until you realize this place spans like a city block and goes on for many floors. The basement is a mixture of coat check-club-bar. The floor doesn't know what it make of itself but it seems to be where the drunkest people congregate. The second floor is the main floor and it features another bar, with bathrooms, and rooms where people sit and drink with table service. There is another floor, the 'library' floor which is this odd combination of library and drinking room. But its where people sit to drink and chat. Now, the final floor is perhaps where things get most interesting. This is the straight-up 'club' floor with its own bar, dancing platforms, and smoking room. There is nowhere to sit and its pure Dirty Dancing Havana Nights. The discotheque tends to be get packed, sticky, and raunchy. Which are qualities that are really best suited for the really inebriated. They have a patio so you can duck off for a quick smoke and the hit the floor soon after if you're so inclined. \n\nThe crowd is really a bizarre mixture of people. Gangsters, slutty Anglophone girls, American tourists who stumbled across the first watering hole, Quebeckers from the east end, some gays, some Latinos, Arabs, etc. etc. There is no 'typical' clientele at this place and it plays to every niche you could think of. Attention girls: most of my girlfriends agree this place attracts the 'aggressive' types unlike any other bar/club in the city. There are guys on the prowl here and they're looking for ass. So be forewarned (maybe because theres a strip joint across the street??) you'll be groped. \n\nBut: the drinks are cheap cheap cheap. Make sure you ask the bartender for the nightly specials. They often have draft beer for like $2.50 which is pennies compared to most places. I always stick to beer/shots here if only because the bartenders could not make a proper mixed drink to save their life. Also, it TIP the bartenders. They're VERY aggressive about tipping--I guess cause many people don't--and they will flat out ask you to tip/give more money if they're not satisfied. $2/drink is the minimum. Now, if you DO tip you'll get great service for the rest of the night and they'll come to you first even if they're faced with a bar full of other patrons. So open your wallets to enjoy friendly bartenders and plentiful drinks. It helps to speak French here too (like most places in Montreal) for all you bilinguals in the crowd.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "I hate to be one of those obnoxious people who come from Montreal and compare everything in Toronto to how much 'better' everything is in Montreal--but to be honest the Holts Cafe in Montreal is about 10x better. First of all this location is great, perched high above Bloor Street looking out at the plebeians below you with an open airy feeling because of the large windows and skylight. My mum, boyfriend, and I ate along the window which was great--not too cold for all you concerned about Canadian winter weather. Our server was fine, nothing special rather pedestrian if I do say so myself. He welcomed us, took our drink orders, and returned to take our orders. No chit-chat which is either good or bad depending on how you like your servers. \n\nMy main concern was the food. The menu is small which I think is good for an operation like Holts Cafe. Its best to keep it simple and focused. Like Montreal the Toronto location offers the infamous tartines--open-faced Scandinavian inspired sandwiches--on French poil\u00e2ne bread. I love the tartines but because Toronto only offers 5-6 options (versus 10-12 in Montreal) I opted to try something else. My eyes immediately honed in on the Chicken Pot Pie which was fine. Just fine. Nothing too spectacular. The puff pastry was really quite tasty, but the 'chicken' inside was shredded and rather sad in quantity. I recently had a Chicken Pot Pie at Bannock (in the rapidly improving the Bay on Queen St. W.) which had huge chunks of fresh chicken breast. The Holts incarnation was tasty but gurrrrl I'm hungry, I'm not one of those ladies who like to lunch who pick at their food, drag it around the plate, and then claim rather exuberantly 'I'm full!'. No no I like my meals and I like them filling. \n\nMy boyfriend had the Holts Burger which was good (I had to steal a bite!) with fries which were actually really good, with a nice sprinkling of spices with an assortment of dips including garlic aioli mayo (my favourite!). My mum had a tartine (the Grilled Chicken) but unfortunately it seemed like the chicken was of the 'lunch meat' variety rather than slices of chicken breast. The Montreal tartines with chicken had a different kind of chicken and I was a little disappointed by this variation. Although each restaurant has a different executive chef I would expect some sort of standardization in terms of the tartines. Oh well they were sufficient. The cocktails that we ordered--the special Very Berry Cocktail--was expensive ($14) and tiny, served in a champagne flute. While the main ingredient was prosecco I felt like a cocktail like this would best be served in a cocktail glass. But than again, I'm no bartender. \n\nThis Holts underwent a renovation a few years back and the rest of the store is of high aesthetic quality. But like any high-end department store or boutique in Toronto I always feel like the service is severely lacking. All of the sales associates--save for one in Louis Vuitton department downstairs--has been so fucking snooty. Why is this such a trend? I KNOW you work on commission, lighten up a little bit and I'll buy more. Crikey. Anyways thats for another review.\n\nBottom line: Holts Cafe is fab to the eye and super chic.

Its close for us McGill students and get really busy on Monday night when there is 10% of your purchase over $50 with a student ID. The President's Choice branded products are good, I have yet to be disappointed from frozen foods (chicken wings and fingers are particularly good) to pasta sauce and ice cream. The prices here are high compared to its suburban counterparts but I find their prices to be lower than nearby Metro. The service is bad. The unionized staff care little for the  cleanliness of the store itself and the cashiers are generally unfriendly and unhelpful. They often have good prices for beer and wine, so stock up when they're on sale. If you are buying a lot of goods, and you don't have a car, they over delivery for $1. The delivery takes a few hours at least, so if you're cupboards are bare you might want to carry home. The reason I shop here is because its the closets thing to a 'superstore' that we have in downtown MTL. They have a full pharmacy--with helpful pharmacists. So its definitely a one-stop shop: drugs, fresh food, alcohol (beer and wine only), and an extensive selection of frozen foods. So come here if you must, its well located for McGill students and cheaper than Metro.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "Ok Ok--this place is ok, not stupendous by any means but decent. The place is a little walk-up resto on a side street in downtown Montreal. Please note--and this is important--it is CASH only. They have an ATM machine in the resto but its a white-label one that charges you $1.50 to withdraw, and you're bank will also charge you at least another $1.50 but BRING CASH. Many patrons find this out only after having ordered their burger and they're forced to make the trek to the bank machine even though they'd really rather not. Anyways to the food. The burgers are DRY, like not juicy goodness like you'd hope but well-done, cooked a little too long, and DRY, let me emphasize DRY. you need to put condiments on there. My boyfriend and I spread garlic mayonnaise on the bun and that made a world of a difference. I agree with another reviewer who says you cannot--I repeat, cannot--taste the caramelized onions. So don't thing those will hold you over, you'll need to pony up the dough and add something from the optional menu. I suggest a cheese--brie is nice, etc. etc.--and probably bacon, just to add to the flavour (which is, quite honestly, lacking). \n\nThe burgers are much better at a chain restaurant like Harvey's. I know know the hipster side of me is scolding me for encouraging people to go to a corporate behemoth like Harvey's, but truth be told their burgers really are much better (and they're grilled; not microwaved like McDonald's). This place is nice for a different burger experience; it is definitely higher end than a typical Harvey's location, for example. As others have noted be prepare to wait wait wait. Today there was a group of 5 people in front of us and literally took us 20 minutes to get our burgers. Yes, 20 minutes. You can phone ahead and they'll place you're order for you in advance and then you can pick it up, but often I'm not planning in advance to go to a burger place. I just wanna walk in, order, and eat soon after ordering. This is not an option here. You will have to wait, longingly looking at your fellow diners as they chow down. \n\nSO: why the three stars? I like the fries, and the different kinds of mayo available. They have spicy mayo, wasabi mayo, garlic mayo, regular mayo ... and another one which I forget at the moment. But I highly recommend the spicy mayo. If the pumps do not work, just ask the associate and he/she will provide with you a small container of it. The pumps are often out of commission so be prepared to ask. Also, the homemade lemonade is phenomenal. Today, not so much, a little watered down, but usually its amazing. I would definitely order the lemonade over any other beverage available. Also, you can spike the lemonade with vodka (its a licensed restaurant). This is always a good option if you're visiting/on vacation, stopping in before a night out on the town. \n\nThis restaurant is good for those who are staying in hotels in the area: Le Centre Sheraton, the Marriott, etc. because its close to the hotel, and its not outrageously expensive (I think my burger, fries, and drink was $12 which, while a little pricey for what its worth, is not too too bad). Maybe you'll have a better experience with your burger and pay the price to dress it up, but I was underwhelmed.", "stars": 3}
{"text": "I just had to go Ramsay's new place here in Montreal. I just HAD to. And I can tell you most of the reviews are spot-on: this place is just average. I really really really wanted to like this place, I really did. But truthfully--and I never lie--St. Hubert's rotisserie chicken is better. NO JOKE. Like the taste just wasn't there! I mean the decor is really awesome and the whole atmosphere is really quite alluring and very Montreal but the food was thoroughly average. \n\nMy parents and I all ordered the quarter chicken dinners (dark meat) with the fries and homemade coleslaw. The fries were just plain bad. They were so over-seasoned. I like to think of myself as something of a 'fries expert' as I've had amazing French fries all over the damn place and these were just not up to par! They were bad. Like over fried and just really inedible. Maybe we just got the dregs from the bottom of the frier and we had a bad batch but they were seriously NOT GOOD. The coleslaw was super dry--I much prefer a more 'saucy' coleslaw with my chicken dinners. The gravy was good however, I really did enjoy it. But honestly people you can go down the street to the St-Hubert Express on Parc (south of Prince-Arthur) and enjoy a better chicken dinner for about 1/16 the price. While I salute Gordon for keeping the price points fairly low-ish (like it was $15 for chicken, fries, coleslaw) I still think they're charging too much for what is basically standard fare in any diner here in la belle province. \n\nThe poor waitress was like the only gal working the room too. She was so frantic, running back and forth that she forgot to submit our drink orders and waited soooooo long to clear our plates after we were clearly done. My parents are Anglophones and don't speak French and she made such a fuss out of switching from French to English. I know I know: hot topic, shouldn't mention it but she was noticeably irritated when my parents could not understand her French. ALSO the table was super wobbly and she just laughed about it. Like didn't make an effort to fix it, so we didn't bother to press the issue. ALSO the stools we sat at (near the bar area) were like tiny! Now I am not a big boy by any means but my little ass was squished on that chair and it was highly uncomfortable. Definitely a design over function decision there.\n\nSo if you're a local: go for it, try it out, I've heard the chicken wings and sliders are good (we didn't order them) but if you're looking for grade-A rotisserie chicken check out your local St-Hubert or if you're from Ontario just grab some Swiss Chalet once you're over the border. Nothing exciting here. Now if you're a Gordon Ramsay fan (which I am) it might be worth the trip up to Laurier to enjoy a nice night at a beautifully designed restaurant with adequate food.", "stars": 2}

I went here OFTEN and then, however, I read an article in Globe and Mail that the pad thai here is ridiculously fattening. Like over 1,200 calores fattening.

My hamburger was also cold (the meat itself), soggy bun, and one sorry-looking skinny red onion ring (as well as normal ketchup, mustard, pickle) was on the burger.   As there was no receipt provided (to do their survey as a method of complaint), I did place a complaint with their corporate office and did receive a call from a very polite and apologetic manager who volunteered to replace my food and my frosty.  I explained that I felt his crew did not provide a receipt so a bad survey could not be done, and they hoped that we would just not say anything.  (Surveys are a ridiculous way for businesses to evaluate performance.  Too easy for fraud.)  Anyway, when a Wendy's craving hits, I will give this location another chance.

{"text": "Dined on Saturday 5/3/14. \n\nI would normally rate this perhaps 3 stars, but being a Daniel Boulud rrestaurant, i expect more.\n\nFood -\nTo start, I ordered the French Onion soup, which to me, lacked enough cheese. I like a gooey French onion soup. For my main,I ordered the Frenchie burger because I heard DB is famous for his burgers. However, the burger that i got was more like a salt brick. The patty itself seemed that it was way over-salted. Plus they added the \"morbier cheese confit pork belly\" which sounds delicious on paper but just added to the saltiness. The burger was so salty, i finished 4 glasses of water and only finished half of the burger. In hindsight, I should have sent the burger back, especially paying $19 for a burger, it should be perfect. Also, I do understand the restaurant just opened, so it could be a learning lesson for the kitchen as well. My friend ordered the lingini and loved it. My other friend order the Yankee burger and loved it as well. So take my words with a grain of....salt. ha.\n\nService -\nWhen our party arrived we were seated immediately in a very nice booth. The restaurant does look like French bistro/brasserie, upscale yet casual. Upon being seated, we waited about 5+ minutes until we received our menus, which I thought was odd. Not sure why the hostess doesn't just hand out the menus (seems inefficient to me). The waitress was very nice and welcoming but seemed very busy. There were a lot of manager looking people standing around. Not sure what they were doing but felt the service could have been more efficient. But again, having recently opened, I'm sure this will be worked out.\n\nOverall, I'm not sure I would recommend this restaurant, especially with all the awesome dining choices you have in Vegas. However, if the food was better (perhaps the kickhen wasn't tasting the food?) and the service kinks were worked out, I do think this could be a good restaurant, especially for the value. If my friends rated this restaurant, they would probably rate it a 4 or 5 stars. However, based on the experience I had, I could not give it more than a 2 and a half,  or 3.", "stars": 2}

A few items on the menu lean towards the greasy - the chicken and blackbean hofun noodles, for example, are difficult enough to eat without being over-lubricated with cooking oil.  The soups are slightly bland - while the idea of a soup with dumplings and fish balls is a solid one, the broth is bit on the weak side.\n\nHowever, there are a few less-standard menu items worth trying - the \"lemongrass pork chop\", while not strictly traditional, is moist and tender and full of good lemongrass flavor.  The weekend congee menu is also the real deal - it's homestyle enough that it attracts a large crowd of international students, and the congee is delicious (which is saying something for a rice porridge).  They don't skimp on the additions (I'm partial to the sliced pork and preserved egg), and the available special appetizers (spicy beef tripe, fried bread, chicken feet with black bean) are worth trying.  Their homemade chili-garlic sauce is a winner, too - spicy and garlicky, it's worth picking up a jar (which they sell at the counter).  It's oily, so is best used in small quantities, but is really quite delicious.\n\nService is primarily counter-based, and a bit on the charmingly grumpy side, although some may find it less charming than others.", "stars": 3}

He ordered the bores head and I ordered the Fred Flinstone rib.  Both of these dishes took a little over an hour to cook, so we had time to enjoy some chicken wings while we waited.  The wings were cooked in duck fat, rather than conventional oil.  These were by far the best wings I ever had.  The flavor was just plain outstanding.  Very savory, with a flavor you might associate with lime, but is actually ginger.\n\nThen, our main dishes were served.  It seemed like everyone sitting around us stopped what they were doing and watched the spectacle that was our dinner.  The plates that were placed in front of my uncle and I were not plates, but rather platters with enough food on each to feed a small family.  I almost felt intimidated trying to figure out where in the world to begin.  It truly looked like a meal Fred Flinstone would eat if he was a real person.\n\nThe rib flavor was similar to a good roast beef.  However, it was a chore separating the fat (lots of it) from the edible pieces.  After a while, I just got tired of the taste and gave up on it.  I'm not saying it wasn't good because it was.  I just think the dish is more about the \"overall experience\".\n\nI wish there was a half star option because I would have given 3.5 stars instead of 3.  Excellent service, small mixed drink portions, excellent wings, decent entrees, pretty much sum up my opinions about Greenhouse.  Thank you for reading.", "stars": 3}

{"text": "Any company can deliver a bad experience on occasion, so rather than post my review immediately I sent the company an e-mail (copied verbatim below) so they could have an opportunity to take some corrective action. The fact that they ignored my e-mail is the largest reason for the low rating-- if a company couldn't care less about a customer experience this bad, they have no right to exist.\n\n\"Rather than post a review with my experience right away, I thought I might contact you directly, as the service I got Monday night may be of concern to you. I took Car #109 from the airport to 103 Avenue Rd. The car was clean and the driver was friendly enough, but it may be time for him to take an in-service. On the road, his handling of the vehicle was a bit jumpy, and though it was too dark to tell, I began to suspect he was using his left foot for the brake, and rocking between that and the accelerator. He was wearing a heavy coat and hat with earflaps, and kept the temperature of the car at a level comfortable for him. I had just returned from the tropics, and was wearing only a thin fleece, but didn't say anything till he lowered his window while on the 401 and began driving with it open (I believe the outside temp. was about 10 deg.). At my destination, though I directed him twice to enter the circular drive in front of the building and stop under the portico, he stopped on the street, nearly 2 feet from the curb, and had me get out there, in the rain. This is not what I expect to pay 60 bucks for.\"", "stars": 2}

I found this particularly frustrating because I had chosen the place specifically because I had a regular appointment nearby that ended at 12:00, so I figured I could drop in on the way back home and it would be perfect. Not so. Possibly half the time they were not there by 12:15, so as not to waste time I went somewhere for lunch, then came back, and usually they were there by 1:00. But that added the cost of the lunch and the lost time to the cost of the tanning package, so it ended up expensive.\n\nAlso, I found it a little off-putting that there were usually one or two guys-- possibly assistants-- who were just hanging around in the cramped space. One time one of the guys had a huge gym bag of laundry sitting beside him with his underwear displayed on top.\n\nSo if you like the feeling of tanning in someone's home, it's clean and friendly and might just be for you.", "stars": 3}

{"text": "Certified Tire used to be the best there is-- trustworthy, competent and reasonably priced-- and so I have been a faithful client of theirs since about 1987. But in the last 2 or 3 years their standards have dropped-- Frank just doesn't seem to care any more. Probably 4 out of 5 times I have had to go back to the shop after service, in order to get something fixed that wasn't done right. And in the last couple of years there have been a couple of major things that they have slipped up on, and he just refuses to take any responsibility for them. For example, he always kept track of routine service intervals for me and I could rely on him to let me know when service was needed. Recently my transmission began making noise, and on checking I realized the fluid had not been changed for about 170,000 km. His only response? \"Good thing it wasn't a Ford-- it wouldn't have survived.\" In another incident, I had asked them to replace some dash lights that had burned out. Despite three tries the lights they installed are still mismatched. But more serious, following the last time they worked on it, a custom disconnect switch I had had them install a couple of years before was no longer working. Though they are the only people who had ever touched the car, they refused to acknowledge that either the original connection was poorly done, so came apart when disturbed, or the guy replacing the lights had damaged it. All Frank was willing to do was unplug a couple of connectors under the hood to do what I had installed the disconnect for. When I finally took the car to another shop to have them look at it, I found that in doing the work-around, they had also torn some rubber protective skirts around the connectors, so now I have to replace those as well.  It is really hard to give up on somebody I have trusted with my and my wife's cars for decades, but I am not going back.", "stars": 2}

{"text": "This is a mediocre car wash at best.  Yah they hand wash it but only wash about 70% of the car when it's wet, where it's supposed to be cleaned, then they clean the rest with spray bottles and towels when they're supposed to be drying it.  Especially when it comes to wheels.  When I asked the manager/service writer guy about it he said the owner wants as many cars through as possible, while he was agreeing with me, so they rush them through.  You have to walk the workers around and point out the mistakes and/ or missed parts that you payed for.  They now say there is an inspection person that checks quality but I've never seen a person checking cars ever.  The tire dressing they use and the way they apply it causes it to fling down the side of your vehicle, thus you have to ask them to apply it light, and / or wipe the tires down before you leave.  There are two workers I've noticed that actually work hard and clean your vehicle well.  The rest come and go with little to no training I'm sure.  They waste alot of water I noticed even though they are labeled as a water recycle wash, they even have a river through the dirt area downstream from the wash that has plants and weeds flourishing from the water that is wasted.   I've contacted the SNWA about it to no avail (sp).  The mats aren't actually cleaned also, they apply a chemical and agitate it with a brush... done, nothing removed.  Not the dirt and not the cleaner they applied.  It also takes over an hour for even just a basic wash.  Oh... and the person that sits in your car while it's going through the wash part will rifle through your compartments for whatever reason, steal your change at the least, and mess with your radio if not just to see how loud it will go.  \nHope this helps anyone to know what they're getting into.  And check your vehicle before you leave. \nPS - Just watched them park my wet vehicle in the hot sun next to the two empty spots in the covered shaded area, nice.  Hope not to be back.", "stars": 2}

She gave no instructions on how to change things to help kids advance and was solely focused on getting the new instructor through the class script. She also wasn't prepared for the class in having the right amount of equipment for all the kids -- if all the kids are at the stage of using the noodle boat, there should be one for all of them and not get huffy when her student instructors point out that all the kids need one.

The location is off the strip but they do provide a complimentary shuttle bus to Caesars, and you can always get a taxi. \nWalking through the casino they had a lot of different mini shows going on, some waitresses would sing, bartenders would flare etc. \n \nWe got a great deal to stay here so I was really happy to see what we got for how little we paid. (I paid about the same to stay on the strip for half as long and the room was very similar)", "stars": 3}

{"text": "This was my second visit to Red.  The first visit was truly delicious, one of the best steaks I've ever had.  So in celebration of my retirement, my family took me there.  I was sorely disappointed.  I ordered a strip steak, medium rare.  It came well overdone.  For $50 just for the ala carte steak, you would think they would know how to cook it.  They brought me another one fairly quickly, but it had been rushed and was too rare and had not been given any time to rest.  To make matters worse, the manager was un-gracious in handling the situation.  Since I had to wait for my second steak, I was not able to enjoy my glass of wine with it.  I thought a second glass as compensation for the mishandled entree would be fair.  The manager refused, though not directly -- he made the poor waitress deliver the refusal, and then only after I asked a second time.  So, strike one: over cooked steak, strike two: under cooked steak, strike three: whole thing handled very badly by the management.  At this price point, it should be perfect the first time.  And when things go wrong as they sometimes do, it should be handled graciously.  This was a very unpleasant experience and I will never go back to Red!  Oh, one more thing... as we were leaving a man in the parking lot asked us how our meal was.  I don't know who he was, but he acted like he was with the ownership.  He asked for my name and phone number and promised to call me to see if he could turn our opinion around.  4 days later, no call.", "stars": 2}

{"text": "I'm an avid spa-goer, and was excited when I received a gift card for this particular spa.  I booked a massage and a facial.  I have to say, to my dismay, that my experience was less than stellar.  \n\nThe decor was quaint, certainly nice for a small spa, and they have a lovely aquarium in the cozy...well, tiny...waiting area.  They have one changing area behind a curtain and a wooden chest to put your belongings in (you are assigned a drawer).  Unfortunately, there is no lock on these drawers, so you feel obligated to drag your purse around with you.\n\nAs for the massage, the atmosphere of the room was nice, good music, perfect lighting.  The massage itself was very well done, very relaxing.  Unfortunately, another employee accidentally walked into the room after the massage had started.  This obviously should not have happened, and made it difficult to relax again.  I might also suggest that the spa invest in heaters for the blankets.  Other spas I've gone to have had this, and it's made the experience so much more relaxing, whereas at Hydeaway, I found my feet to be quite cold.  Despite these minor disturbances, the massage was fine.\n\nThe facial was another story.  I found it to be sloppy and not relaxing at all.  The esthetician used a scrub on my face early on in the facial, but then used the same scrub-covered gloves throughout the entire facial.  Needless to say, I felt like there was grit on my face throughout the entire facial.  In addition to that, the esthetician failed to remove the scrub entirely from my face after the facial was over.  I left the spa with clumps of scrub in my face, neck, and even in my ears.  I've had several facials from several spas, and this was one of the worst. \n\nFurthermore, I found some of the staff (not all) to be unprofessional.  At the completion of my spa experience while I was making my way back to the changing area, I overheard two staff members talking about upselling me skin-care products, at which point they noticed me and quickly shut the door.  I was very unimpressed.  \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this spa and will not return.", "stars": 2}

We ordered from the prix fixe menu, and the varieties sounded delicious.  My mother and I ordered the same salad, and to our dismay, both of our salads arrived with no dressing.  After the waiter suggested that it was \"lightly dressed\" (it wasn't), he brought out some dressing for us.  For our entree, three of the four of us ordered the scallops.  The flavours were good, however the cleaning of the scallops was careless; all three of us experienced a gritty texture in our food (perhaps sand).  The dessert, on the other hand, was very tasty.

The tacos shells are deep-fried, which gives them a crispiness without allowing them to crumble in your hands the way baked corn shells are wont to do.  Their salsa (they hand you a refrigerated bottle at the register when you place your order) was flavorful and had just the right amount of spice for me.  The side of rice and beans that came with this were just OK...the rice was a bit dry, and the beans a bit watery.  Still, though...you can't go wrong with the tacos.  I had chicken, but the beef ones are every bit as good when I've ordered them in the past.  (As a side note, if you eat in, they apparently bus your table for you.  I was wandering around up front and by the door, trying to find a place to set my tray and dishes, but there isn't one.)  If you're looking for a healthy meal, this is probably not the restaurant you want to end up at.  But, if you're in the mood for simple Mexican fare that has been consistently good over the years at a restaurant that is more upscale than the \"-bertos\" clones, I highly recommend you give them a shot.

Based on others' reviews around the time we visited (March 12), I can only conclude that something was horribly amiss with their workforce.  Our party of 5 was seated quite quickly, but it was in the outdoor bar area.  It was still a bit chilly outside, but patio heaters took care of that, once they found one that worked and wasn't out of fuel.  Service to our table was spotty at best -- our drink orders were taken and processed quickly, but we kept waiting...and waiting...and waiting for the guy to come back and take our dinner orders.  I had the macaroni and cheese, but as somebody else pointed out, it was bland and had that consistency like Velveeta where if you don't eat it while it's piping hot, the cheese solidifies.  The type of pasta they used was not great either -- it was rather stringy and broke into small bits very easily, especially once the cheese had congealed around it.  I managed to eat about half of it before giving it up as a lost cause.  When it finally came time to get the check, our waiter was on his break which added another 15-20 minutes onto our time spent/wasted there.  That's fine, everybody is entitled to a break, but if you don't designate somebody else to take care of your tables when on break, you're going to have unhappy customers -- something that people who work for tips generally try to avoid.  All told, we were there for almost three hours.\n\nOther \"highlights\" from the night (which weren't necessarily the fault of the restaurant but contributed to the overall \"ick\" factor) include: one of the stray cats that others have mentioned was roaming the patio; a party of annoying suburban mouth breathers was seated nearby, where one of the guys lit up a cigar and gagged all of us (we overheard the bartender being told about it, and he chose to do nothing), and one of the girls had such a shrill cackle it would have put Margaret Hamilton to shame; and then the coup de gr\u00e2ce: as we were leaving through the back exit, we saw a literal WALL of garbage piled around the dumpster. Why were we taking the back exit, you ask? Simple: the wrought iron gates at the front entrance were closed and locked (fire hazard, anybody?!) by the time we were ready to leave, which incidentally was nowhere near the posted closing time of 2AM. I can only assume it's to keep the street people from wandering onto the patio, but how about hiring some security instead?  I love The Vig Uptown, and I really wanted to like this one...but I see no reason to return, especially since I'm so close to Uptown and have had consistently excellent experiences there.  The layout and the location of Fillmore both have potential, but the management needs to get its collective...stuff together and offer a better, more consistent dining experience.", "stars": 2}

I had seen them on Eat24, but since picking up an order from them involves a 9 mile roundtrip, I hadn't gotten around to trying them until tonight.\n\nMy overall impression:  just OK.  I've had better, and I've had worse.  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, and the crust had a dense, pillowy texture that I didn't much care for.  The sauce, cheese and pepperoni on top of the crust were actually pretty tasty, though.  Inexplicably, there was a small section on my pizza that was completely devoid of cheese and pepperoni.\n\nOrdering with Eat24 was easy, although I should point out that there isn't an option for extra cheese on the menu.  I left my house within five minutes of ordering, and when I arrived at the restaurant my pizza had about two minutes to go, so the speed of service was fine.  The quality of service, however, was a bit lacking -- much of which I attribute to the fact that the counter guy was young and probably didn't have a lot of experience.\n\nAs for the value...honestly, it wasn't great.  Without the $2 online coupon I used, the medium 12 inch one-topping pizza I ordered would have cost $13.53, which is higher than what the pizza joints in my neighborhood charge for a comparable or higher quality product.  (Overpriced, average pizza could be one of the reasons I was the only customer inside the place at 7PM on a Saturday night...)\n\nWould I return?  Probably not.

I got the quinoa patty on a sprout bun,with my choice of toppings, and the patty was probably one of the better quinoa patties I've had. The size of the burger is decent, probably around the same size as a The Works burger. Unlike most burger joints, sides aren't included here as a meal. The 3 of us shared a side of fries, which were fine and nothing to rave about.\n\nService: This place would get 4 or 5 stars if not for the service. Our server was pretty rude even though we were nothing but pleasant guests. She slammed my milkshake down on the table. When the burgers arrived, I had my hands on the table.

This probably means that they were mainly focused on the take-out business. Our group of four were seated quickly. The menu is quite large for a small place. You got your choices of sushi, but also your traditional Chinese take-out as well. I ordered deep-fried pork chops with fried rice, vegetables, spring roll, and a Wonton soup. Food came out quickly (around 5 to 10 minutes). The Wonton soup was disappointing (too much wrapping and the meat was bland). The main course, however, was good. Fried rice was done correctly (not too oily and tasted good). The spring roll was crispy and the filling inside was ample. The vegetables were steamed (nothing noteworthy). The pork chops themselves were great (not too much batter, meat temperature was perfect, just slightly spicy). Portion wise, I thought it was perfect, but my friend could not finish half of his Pad Thai. My friend who ordered the sushi said they weren't bad.

Where they did disappoint me was the rice. Though cooked right, it was cold on the outside edges (like it had been sitting there with a draft for a while). Price-wise, it is very comparable with other restaurants nearby (under 10$). Overall, this place fulfills all the requirement to be a successful Chinese restaurant.

You sometimes end up waiting 10-15 minutes and maybe more. The only time I've not seen long lines here was at 8am.

The meatloaf is to die for, grilled cheese combinations are plentiful and breakfasts cooked to perfection. The staff are pleasant, knowledgable and eager to make your visit an enjoyable one. Even so, my review has fallen short to average unfortunately due to the slightly high prices as well as the abundance of grease and grossly over cooked vegetables. If you're sticking to meat and cheese you'l be golden, else be wary.", "stars": 3}

They moved the lines in a relatively efficient manner, considering the amount of clerks behind the long counter.. (about half of stations occupied) Very friendly staff through out, room was clean, beds comfy, water had a funky smell and color when you first turned it on!!

Just not good!!   The only reason we used it twice is because two free ones were included in our package...so we just paid for the kids the two mornings we ate there..we skipped the last free ones and opted for McDonalds, on the way home!!  We would stay here again..but not dine here...casino was generous too!! :)", "stars": 3}

Most of us are Japanese-American and are not use to that kind of  treatment.  A larger, taller framed officer arrived and asked us to move to the other side of the gaming machines.

By the time someone /finally/ acknowledges me, I try and speak in a friendly way while I get my order, but I'm met with grumbled answers, or lethargic movements.

I had just gotten out of the hospital , had passed this place a dozen times as I live about a 1/2 mile up the road, am a former New Yorker and wanted a little comfort food and taste of home.\n\nThere were 4 people behind the counter and it took 20 minutes to get 2 hot dogs made correctly, a shaved ice, soda and a smoothy.  There was no line when I and my friend walked it, though we were followed by several others about 8 minutes after we arrived.\n\nThe hot dogs are not New York hot dogs, they are rather tasteless, soft 1/4lb dogs like one might get from 7-11. they weren't even hot, just simply warm and the bun seemed stale on the outside.\n\nI had to remind the young man that was helping me three times of what it was I ordered.  When that was finally done, I looked at my hot dog to see if was made incorrectly and I asked him to take care of it, which he sent me to the other counter, so I politely said, please would you handle it.  The person making food was not very polite and when I asked that he remake both hot dogs so they are hot as they had gone colds he replied with an eye roll and a \"are you kidding me\" and then questioned me as to why I had not eaten the hot dog while waiting for the other things, when I had asked for the items \"To go\". He actually packaged the 2 dogs in a rather large pizza box, which seemed strange.\n\nThe lemon shaved ice was tasty, my friend said and I enjoyed the mango smoothy, but after the wait and attitude, which I think was the owner, I will not be returning. I gave 2 stars rather than one as the Italian ice and the smoothy was rather good.", "stars": 2}

We were okay with this... except that the food actually took 3 hours to arrive.

One piece of bread toasted heavy or flat grilled on one side and the other Slice of bread not toasted at all. It was a bit of an odd technique -  if it was intended. Hardly any turkey on it at all - maybe 40 - 45 grams tops. It had a small single piece of tomatoe that was mushy and had chopped wilted lettuce. Salad was a side portion that cost an extra 2$ but was an extra small side salad with a few very small bits of the highlight ingredients in the salad - so sparse - I had to examine it to ensure proper identity of the ingredients that it matched the description. The bread was multigrain which is a bit dry most places you get it but my bread was sufficiently dry that it caused the top slice corners of the bread to curl up.

We had quite a large group and were there within their first month open, so it was almost to be expected.  However we were assured they could handle our group so we gave it a shot.  The service was slow at best.  Our waitress didn't seem to know how to handle a large table and made it a point to tell us that many, many times.  She made us feel like a burden, but reminded us that she had 20 years experience (so I'm not sure what the problem was).  We were later visited by the owner, and I believe some friends who didn't even work there who he called in to help - bonus points.  Still, after being told we couldn't order anything beside basic drinks (because the bartender \"probably won't know how to make them), we waited forever for water, beer, and eventually food.  I can't vouch for anyone else because frankly I wasn't paying attention, but my veggie burger seemed like something from the Sysco truck.  Not impressed.\n\nTry #2: Brunch.  Service was still slow and confused, but much better.  The Eggs Royale were commendable - their salmon has a uniquely mild and delicious flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  I was looking forward to trying one of their pastries, but was disappointed with the selection.  The pastry case looked bored.  With only about 3 different choices, the pastries looked good but unimpressive for bakery standards.  They had a selection of macaroons, which although likely fresh, seemed a bit pricey at $3.75 each.  I ended up skipping the pastries.\n\nLastly, and most notably, the place lacks personality.

The toast was overly saturated in a liquid butter grease.  The only saving grace this morning was our waitress and coffee!  Truly flabbergasted in what has happened!!!", "stars": 2}

Ruth Cris is a safer bet for my money.", "stars": 2}
{"text": "We went to Toscana on Sunday night for supper. Based on the website and the menu, I expected something a bit more classy. \n\nThe look of the restaurant is half restaurant, half sports bar, with big screen tv's over the bar and in the corner of the dining room. The coat racks all had packing tape holding them together, which would be such as easy thing for them to fix. The restaurant was clean, but it's casual atmosphere does not mesh with their menu pricing. Even the bathroom had a Cellphone company ad on the wall, seeming much more like a pub than a nice restaurant. It feels like they are cutting corners in all areas - even having some tablecloths to cover the cheap pub-style tables would be a step in the right direction.\n\nService was prompt. The food... meh. We started with a few appetizers, which all tasted fine, just a bit bland. The olives were pretty good, but the bruchetta and the asiago dip could have been from any grocery store deli. Our Caesar salad had wilted lettuce that was browning on the edges. The salad itself was unremarkable. For our main, we shared a pizza. Again, just ok. The dough was tough and chewy. Mismatched plates, but not in a warm, cosy family way, just... mis-matched. \n\nOverall, the pricing of $75 for two people (having a shared entree) did not match the bland quality of the food, nor the atmosphere. Quite disapointing, and I will certainly not go back. The folks at the table nearest us had sent back their dish, so I felt like our experience was not unusual.\n\nCalgary has no shortage of Italian restaurants, but this one misses the mark on food, ambiance and overall experience.", "stars": 2}

She did a nice job of my cuticles, and shaped my nails well. \n\nMy shellac however was dull - very uneven shine, with some nails being completely dull and almost matte looking. There were  a few rough spots on the ends of my nails, and within a day, those areas began to chip. I think the technician was in a rush and so perhaps I didn't get quite the level of service I would have otherwise. My advice is do not take the last appointment of the day! I'm on day three of this manicure and I will likely remove it tonight and re-do myself.", "stars": 2}
{"text": "I was so excited to check out The Nash. I work in Inglewood, and my work team likes to have lunch out together every month or so. The Nash has been on our wish list for a while.\n\nFirst impressions: the restaurant is gorgeous. Beautiful decor, a great mixture of the industrial exposed piping and nice rustic wooden tables. The tables are all set elegantly - I love the tea-towel napkins.\n\nThe menu looks interesting - certainly very meat-focused, but luckily I'm not vegetarian. The average lunch item was about $18 for a burger or sandwich.\n\nOf the ten of us at the table, we each felt an overwhelming sense of 'meh' about our items. Several had the burgers, all noted that the salad has a great dressing, but they felt the burger was over seasoned: heavy on the oregano-type herbs. \n\nI ordered the reuben. The sandwich itself was nice, piled high with meat and lots of cheese. The mustard was very light, I personally prefer a more zingy mustard, but it was still a decent reuben. There was a side of pickles, and a side of chips. When I say side, keep in mind I mean six potato chips (I counted.) That would have been ok if the chips were freshly made but they were cold, so even if they were made in-house it wasn't to order. The chips were too heavily salted to finish. It seems like they just subbed in Old Dutch kettle chips and thrown on some coarse salt.\n\nMy table-mate ordered the reuben as well, and asked if he could switch the sides out for coleslaw. The server said that wasn't possible as the coleslaw was only served with the brisket. He asked her to check if it was possible. She came back with the reuben with the standard sides, as well as a side dish of coleslaw and charged him for it, which seemed a bit cheap. He would have prefered the server say \"no, I'm sorry we can't make substitutions, would you like a side order?\" The coleslaw was bot edible as it was sour instead of tangy like a good slaw should be.\n\nStaff was efficient and friendly - no complaints there. Essentially this is a great looking place, with a staff who obviously are good at what they do, but it all falls apart on the food. The food is your basic diner-level food, but certainly not at diner-level prices. \n\nThere are so many great places in Inglewood, I'm disappointed that The Nash isn't one of them.", "stars": 2}

It took awhile to get drinks and menus, we eventually both ordered the specials - the burger special and the daily steak sandwich special. I ordered the steak med and it came out very well done. The burger was ok. First I was impressed that the waitress brought out pop refills before we were even done our glass, without asking, then found out when we got the bill they charged for each refill. That seemed a bit sleazy. They don't have wireless debit machines so my server sent me to wait at the bar. There were six people ahead of me so it was a long wait. \n\nOverall - the food and service is much better at other local spots so skip Partners unless you are just going for a beer and to watch the game.", "stars": 2}

{"text": "I've been to Basil twice. The first time, I went for lunch the second week it was open. I had chicken mussaman curry, which is my favorite thai curry  dish, and thai iced tea.  The thai tea was particularly good and the curry was satisfying if not a bit heavy on the coconut milk.  It did compare in price and taste to Thai Taste (which is the best Thai in the city IMHO). \n\nMy second visit was for dinner this past weekend. I had a gift certificate to use as part of CLT restaurant week promotion. For an appetizer I split the shrimp hot and sour soup with my boyfriend.  This was excellent, a good balance of tangy and spicy, and the presentation was nice.  For dinner he had Pad Thai and I had the signature dish, crispy red curry duck.  His Pad Thai was not impressive just okay as far as the thai staple goes. It seemed to have too much rice wine vinegar in it. You can definitely find better and cheaper elsewhere. The crispy red curry duck was disappointing. The duck had obviously been fried earlier in the day and sat in it's sauce for a while because it was not crispy, nor was the meat particularly juicy. The sauce was delicious but I expected a lot more for $25 and  promise of the chef's signature.  The biggest disappointment of the night though was not being able to order dessert. All through dinner I watched the large open kitchen push out orders of green tea fried ice cream and I couldnt wait to get some.  But when we went to order dessert our waiter told us the kitchen was closed.  I found this really surprising. I've worked as a server before in places no where near as nice as this, and we always asked our tables if they wanted anything else before the restaurant closed down the kitchen. \n\nYou are definitely paying for the modern upscale atmosphere when you eat at Basil.  It's probably a nice spot for those who live nearby. I would recommend trying it for lunch to see if it's for you. But if you want truly good Thai in Charlotte, you don't need to spend more for it here.", "stars": 3}

When I finally got my gyro I was fairly disappointed to say the least - I had tamato ends and no real slices and very little onion with no taziki on the sandwich- it came in a little cup, i had more gyro meat than their street taco sized pita could handle. Sloppily thrown together and thrown into a bag. Rude old man at the front and I paid 4$ more than I would for just the sandwich at my regular spot (flaming kabob).

The pulled pork was cold with no flavor. The sweet bbq sauce we added on was watered down with now spice. The hot bbq sauce wasn't hot at all and again no flavor. The mac and cheese was more like soup and feel like they forgot to bake it. It was very bland and needed tons of salt to even eat. The baked beans also had zero flavor but had large pieces of pork in them.

The bread pudding was really just a banana bread (or so it seemed to be, but it wasn't bread pudding) with caramelized sugar spooned on top, then topped with a small scoop of ice cream.

{"text": "Being generous with that extra star...\n\nSo I came here today after some raving reviews from a friend of mine. She likes this place over In-N-Out and it's super delicious blah blah blah.\n\nCame around 2pm to a short line outside and spoke to the usher guy outside who says he eats 4 of these things a day and brings then back home to his wife...so I start thinking...\"how big are these burgers?\". He explains how the menu works and all that good stuff.\n\nWent inside and waited in the second line and looked over the decor...I don't care...It's about the food. Just looked kinda hipster/umami-esq...No big deal.\n\nEnded up getting a single of the one with bacon and peppers while the gf got a single of their claim to fame (sorry I forget the names). I opted for the single because I couldn't get myself to spend 3 extra dollars for a 4oz meat patty. I got the Chicago style hot dog instead to try more of the menu and fries and topped it off with a concrete (kinda like a blizzard from DQ) with the strawberry and waffle pieces. Got a side of fries and bill came to $28 bucks....whoo...that's...a lot.\n\nGot the pager and waited a few...then got the food. \n\nFirst impressions: looks good. Kinda on the small side burger wise. I little smaller than In-N-Out but bigger patties. Gf has one tomato and one piece of lettuce, mine has a good amount of bacon and peppers. Nice crinkle fries and good looking concrete. Thought a single scoop is pretty small for the price. Chicago dog was Nathan's small but looked the part without the nuclear green relish.\n\nTaste: bacon was good and peppers had little bite. No lettuce or tomato for this...Kinda disappointed. Tasted good but not OMG best thing ever! Bread was like a mix of brioche and hawaiian and was split but not all the way so ended up like a pocket thing. Gf's was good but ordinary. Shack sauce was kinda lacking. Nothing special. The dog was good. Split and grilled. Good condiments but no casing so no \"snap\". The fries are great. Crinkle kept the crunch. Although...for a burger place that tries to exemplify organic and no GMO \"specialty\" burger place, I would have expected real potatoes...not some Sysco or Ore-Ida frozen potatoes for fries. The concrete was good. I liked that. The waffle pieces were crunchy and tasty. The strawberry was good and the ice cream was good. Note I say ice cream...not custard as they advertise. I've had frozen custard...and it had a certain consistency and smoothness and taste...totally different than froyo and ice cream..but this...this was ice cream.\n\nFinal thoughts: I'd come here for dessert. I think the burgers are WAY overpriced. $9 for a small double cheese burger is not worth it. You could get gourmet gastro pub type burgers (huge 1/2 or 1/3lb with all kinds of oddball toppings) for that price. They offer no \"combos\" to help out the pricing. Taste was mediocre. And comparing to major competitors, In-N-Out to me has more flavor, but if not even that...give more veggies and for $9 you can have 3 patties, real hand cut fries, and a drink. 5 guys has many toppings, homestyle taste, fresh cut fries, and a drink as well for around the same price. \n\nI was lucky I was in Vegas to try this place out where spending money comes easy.

{"text": "2.5 is what I'm trying to give here.\n\nSo after seeing some of the reviews (at 24 reviews) they seemed like a decent place to try out.\n\nI felt that I should give them a try.    After coming back from Japan, all ramen places have just been.. blah.\n\nThis one, ramen wise, I wasn't impressed.\n\nThere were 3 of us. Here's what we ordered:\n\n-Yamisou tempura (a root vegetable that's on the specials menu)\n-Pork belly (small)\n-Soft bone pork (small)\n-the original ramen shiso\n-tonkatsu\n-katsu donburi with black curry\n\nThe Yamisou tempura was well fried, lightly tempura battered, and fresh.  It had a good crunch and we were given a choice to dip it in wasabi salt or tempura sauce. Either/or tasted good=)\n\nThe pork belly came with 4 pieces in the small order.  Absolutely terrific in texture and flavour.  It had a lot of fresh scallions on top and the fatty part was melt in your mouth, so we all rather enjoyed it.\n\nThe Pork soft bone came with 4 pieces as well in the small order.  It was nice.  Chewy and wasn't too dried.  It had fresh scallions and sesame seeds on top.  The only thing was, it tasted (flavour wise) exactly like pork belly.  So it became a little boring.\n\n\nOn to the ramen and rice...\n\nMy mum had ordered the original ramen with shiso soup.  She said it was too salty and apart from the salty, there wasn't much flavour at all.  She said her noodles themselves were not the best she's had and they were too soft in texture.\n\nI had ordered the tonkatsu ramen.  I found that my soup base, was a tiny bit oily compared to what I'm used to.  There wasn't much flavour at all.  It was a really large portion, with 3 large pieces of pork.  The pork edges were nicely flavoured, but once again seem to taste like the pork belly and soft bone.  Some parts of the pork did have a that stinky pig smell/taste to it.  The noodle itself, although not yet soggy, it wasn't chewy/crunchy at all.  The noodles also didn't have that ramen tenacity.  I'm not sure if it was because it was over cooked.  We were there around 2pm.\n\nMy bf ordered the black curry.  The name is a little misleading, because there was no actual curry.  The sauces was a really dark sticky, sweet, spicy sauce.  It was thicker than terriyaki sauce and it tasted like sweet black vinegar.  If you're Chinese and you've had the pork leg and egg vinegar soup thing that women have after they give birth, it has that similar taste.  The katsu was crispy and well fried.  I personally didn't mind the sauce, but my bf found it too sweet.\n\n\nAtmospher wise...\n\nThe restaurant is like your local noodle shop, it's nothing fancy and they purposely have \"customer\" comments/writings on the plastic wall.  It's cute and comfy.  The business cards are a smart design that holds your chopsticks.  \n\nThe Service and the operations :\n\nI believe it's a family owned business.  It seems the mom and dad works in the back, while the daughter was serving.  We were there on a Sunday afternoon.  They do open from 11-3 and then break in between before reopening at 6 for dinner.  I'm not sure if the dinner menu is different.  \nThe mum was quick to service us when we arrived.  We took our own seats as there wasn't anyone around.  She came right over to give us menus.  I believe the daughter was in the washroom at the time.  Overall service was quick and informative.  They made sure to advise us that that black curry wasn't going to need 15 mins prep, and asked if that was ok.  They ensure the tea was always filled although there were only 2 tables including ours that day.  They did seem attentive to each table's needs.\n\nOverall:\n\nI found that the snacks were better than the noodles.  I would go back for the pork belly, to try the ox tongue, and maybe to try the dessert (since we were too full) but definitely not the ramen.  The portions seem good for the value.\n\nWould I recommend it? Definitely to try the pork belly, other wise, not really.", "stars": 2}

Called the front desk, Kelly said they were not offering 1pm late checkout to any of the guest. Well, after haggling with Kelly for 20-30 minutes she spoke with another gentleman, James, one of the managers, and agreed to offer 1pm late checkout. Admitted they actually did offered my friends a late checkout which she orgianlly said was not an option. (#5)\n\nAll in all, food was great. XS was great. Ambience and decor was great.

My wife and I are in our sixties.  I know that Taco Mac does the same thing, and I do not go there for that reason.  A manager-type told us that the policy was based on some other bar getting sued for serving alcohol to someone, apparently with a suspended or limited license because of a DUI conviction.  I am not buying it.  The law does not require a bar to check for DUI convictions.  It requires a bar not to serve alcohol to people who are intoxicated.  It is a basic skill everyone who works in a bar serving drinks must have.\n\nThen I was excited to read in the menu, \"We hand-patty our burgers from fresh (never-frozen) ground beef then grill them to order.\"  It is not true.  I tried to order a burger mid-rare and was told they would only serve burgers well or medium well.  They do NOT grill burgers to order.\n\nThe menu also has an enormous selection of food items (do these people never watch Restaurant Impossible?).  Our selections (I chose a buffalo chicken wrap over a burnt burger and my wife had a flatbread) were satisfactory -- no better.\n\nWith our bill we got a note saying that patrons who post a review on Yelp will get a $10 gift certificate.  No wonder the other locations have so many good reviews!  Does anyone want my gift certificate?\n\nIt is an attractive place.  The service was good.

They were very tasty, however.\n\nThe trio of spreads was good, although none of the spreads was exceptional.  \"Ale simmered sausage bites\" in a hot mustard sauce were tasty, but incredibly simple.  The Quattro Framiggio flatbread was the most ordinary; if there was truffle oil as advertised it was overwhelmed by the carmelized onions, and overall the flatbread did not seem to be freshly prepared.\n\nBased on what we had and what we saw on the menu, I would say that the food offered is not as creative as the menu descriptions.

Seriously, 2 slices of bacon on a $9 sandwich billing itself as a BLT???\n\nI quickly got the attention of one of our wonderful servers and asked, \"does this sandwich always come with only 2 slices of bacon?\" Yes, he answered, and immediately offered me more bacon. Within a minute or a so, a plate arrived with 3-4 more slices of bacon. Now that is superior service...very impressive!! \n\nStill, with a 20% tip, this turned out to be a $30 lunch, for 2 sandwiches, 1 side of homefries (oops, hashbrowns), 1 mimosa and 1 sweet tea. That's pretty steep. \n\nHad it not been for that level of service, this would have been a 1 star review all the way.", "stars": 3}

Negotiations took all day. But everything seemed fine and we signed the paperwork. We were happy about the prices offered for our trades. Took the cars home. That was a big mistake.\n\nA week later, after thinking the deals were done. We got a call to come sign new paperwork. So we go into finance and the original deal was off the table. This was on the first car. My trade was evaluated on this paperwork as 4,000 less than agreed to, the loan also had a different rate. On to the second car... \n\nAt this point we were very apprehensive. We put money down on both cars plus have 3,000 worth of cancelables to put towards it. Before we even see any paperwork we are told we have to come up with 4,800 more in cash or the deal won't happen. We couldnt even get to the payment, but the trade was over valued and again we were being shorted $3,000. We said no and asked to negotiate further.  The finance guy said he would try. But had no confidence and dismissed us to come back tomorrow with both vehicles. \n\nI waited the morning for a promised phone call. Nope nothing. I finally got a call later in the day from finance saying no I haven't heard, I will check. But we will see you here tonight. \n\nWe ended up having to work, so I called to change the appointment. No return phone call. \n\nFinance called me the next morning. But said there was nothing they could do and bring the vehicles back. They were done negotiating with us. We offered to put a little more down, to make the deal happen. But we're again told no. \n\nAt this point we've had the cars for 8 days. So I said ok we will just take one car then. Midway would now only if I traded my 2015 camaro, not the one I really wanted to trade which was a 2014 camaro. \n\nAfter my boyfriend spoke to finance one more time to make the deal happen, he was treated badly so we decided to not give them any business what so ever. \n\nI drove my car back, took my old Camaro home and a lot attendant drove my boyfriends car back. He was driving it very slow. I just figured he was nervous. \n\nThe next day my boyfriend goes to leave for work, after putting the plate on he gets in and notices the tire pressure is low. He goes out to look. The attendant that had driven it home curb checked it, took a massive piece of the tire off along with damaging the rim. \n\nI called the dealer to speak to them about it and was told to talk to the GM.", "stars": 3}

Both times I tried to get carved meat, no one was there. I waited the second time for about 3-4 minutes, and no one every offered to help me, even though they were nearby. They also keep very few pies sliced and waiting. Instead, you have to wait for someone to slice is for you.

The only good service we got was from our waitress, who kept our six cups full, and our dirty plates picked up.\n\nThe only saving grace for me was the baklava, a special dessert for the night. If you like snow crab legs, they looked good, but no one at my table wanted to try them.\n\nOverall, the Bistro Buffet is not worth leaving the Strip for if you are visiting. The buffets at Wynn and the Cosmo are better, even if they do cost more.

At this point the product is all over my cuticles and hands. I washed my hands after finishing and the polish is already chipping off, revealing the base coat. I'm thankful that the owner reinforced that it never happens to her own clients and that I wasn't just being picky, and she asked my tech to fix my nails. She filed the polish back off, reshaped my nails again, and did black with a glitter topcoat.

Since this is an all you can eat one would imagine that they are fully stocked on meat.\n\n-visited about 2 weeks apart and the beef bulgogi changed at my second visit- I found it tasted a bit funky and was a different cut of meat than the first time.

Maybe consider prepping your meats to avoid customer wait time.. our rice was going cold by the time the meat went on the grill. \n\n- We came one hour before closing last night and was turned away because of \"last call\" and \"kitchen is closed.\" Your kitchen is full of raw meat dude, you don't have to cook a thing!

Nice. \n\nHonestly.. just had such high hopes hearing about this place but found it so unorganized, their staff is all over the place and I hope they figure out a system that runs smoothly because it's quite hectic.", "stars": 2}

{"text": "Ate here last night for a large birthday party. Ordered a NY strip steak and specified that I like it well done, no pink whatsoever and that if they needed to butterfly the steak then it's perfectly fine (cutting the steak in half to open up the center). When I got my steak, I cut into the center and it was entirely pink and immediately blood gushed out all over my plate. The reason I prefer well done, is because blood makes me incredibly nauseous. I asked the waitress to correct it and she took it back.  Brought it back out about 5 minutes later and it was barely a change. What surprised me most is that they didn't just start a new steak and bitterly cut it as I had requested. Instead, she came back out with the same steak, now almost entirely black!! The inside was well done of course, but my steak was a completely dry, chalky hockey puck. I just boxed it up and took it home for my dogs. I understand that when asking for a steak well done, it will be dryer than usual. But because of the constant on and off the grill my steak at elephant bar was like jerky.

I read one review where it said the wings were slow cooked and the meat falls off so I was hoping it would be as good as McKoy's wings on South blvd.  I live down the street so I was hoping for something closer. \n\nI called in for take out and was recommended the jamacian jerk and chipolte apricot flavors.  I brought the order home, opened it and found the majority of the wings were burnt.  Now I'm a guy that usually likes wings a little dried out and don't mind it a little burned.  It's too bad the flavors were also very bland.  I wasn't even sure which flavor was which.  The wings don't really seem like it was slowed cooked either, just seemed like regular wings.  I probably would have been better off getting wings from Fuel Pizza.  \n\nOne good thing is they gave me two large blue cheese jars with the wings.  I guess they know you would need a lot to cover the burnt taste and the lack of flavor.  They also have a lot of different beers so it might be a cool place to drink.  That also leads to me believe the reviewers that liked the wings were drunk.  \n\nNot sure if I want to even go back for anything else.

The grilled mushrooms with white truffle was good, although I would have preferred more truffle (it still was a good amount). I had a yuzu sorbet for dessert (tastes like a sweet lemon, kind of like frozen lemonade). I've been here before to their more private shabu shabu section. Where they serve a very expensive omakase.

I had the ribeye wagyu steak and it was the worst I have ever had. It was strange, some of my pieces would be really dry and then other pieces would be overwhelmingly marbleized and fatty. I couldn't get a happy medium piece. The soy based sauce that came with it helped it a lot.\n\nOther than that, the stone crab appetizer I had was very good and fresh. I didn't like the seared foie gras (I prefer the smooth spreadable kind, this was the lumpy really livery looking kind). I had a taste of the butternut squash soup which was excellent. The mushroom side was perfect, but the truffle mashed potatoes was lacking in truffle. For dessert I had the poached pear and the coconut souffle. The poached pear dessert seemed a little bland to me. The souffle was really good and it was nice to have a coconut variation of it.

I had the Pinapple Pico Burger (priced at $12), I'm not really sure why they call it this, because I tasted none of the so called Pinapple Pico, as a matter of fact there was not much flavor at all! The meat was not seasoned at all and was very dry. I ordered the house homemade chips instead of fries and although they were okay, they also needed more seasoning and I got wayyyyy to many of them...covered half the plate! My husband had their wings and they looked really good and he liked them. For 5.99 you get 8 wings or 1 lb. My kids ordered off the childrens menue and each had a cheeseburger. It was the right size for kids, but a little skimpy on the fries. I was however disappointed with the price of the kids menu...$5 and the drink was NOT included...that was $2 more, so basically $7 for a slider and a few fries and drink. Our waitress was nice enough, although I have to say she was pretty unknowledgeable about the bar drinks, when asked what flavors of vodka they had she gave a blank stare...all she had to do was turn around as they were all right behind the bar. There was another couple with us and we all had the same burger...cooked differently and they gave me my friends burger and me his. Need to be more observant I guess.

The \"port wine cheese\" that I made the mistake of thinking would be actual cheese was in fact port wine cheese SPREAD akin to the cracker spread in the tub. SERIOUSLY?? The burger itself was cooked fine and was seasoned. I ordered sweet potato fries as a side and they were not only way overcooked (or had been sitting over a fryer for to long) and cold. My friend also ordered the sweet potato fries and hers were the same. We asked for a new batch and the ones that came out were obviously fresh made and you could see the difference...wish now that I would have taken a pic to share to compare the difference!

I ordered the gumbo, which generally has shrimp and uses veggies like celery! Bell peppers and onions. Theirs has none of this, instead what I got was a brown goo with what appeared to be canned chicken and beef. I also ordered the boudin balls, again not good. The outside was nice and crisp, but the inside was nothing but rice and raw breading \"paste\". Where was the boudin? My husband had the andouille sausage, he said it was ok, but it was literally a sausage with mustard on what looked like an uncooked bun (it was white!). Our friends had the oyster po boy and the shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e. I had a bite of he po boy and thought it was awful...maybe I just don't like oysters, but my friend said it was just so so. The shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e got an ok review by my other friend, however it he menu said it came with rice...you had to look really hard for the rice under what looked like the same brown goo they called gumbo. One of the sides that was ordered was the Mac and cheese...it had no cheese flavor, needed salt and all the macaroni noodles were broken up and scooped into a glob.\n\nThe extended bar is nice and they could really turn that place into a great neighborhood bar, the food just needs some major tweaking. We were there on a Saturday night and they had karaoke which is always fun, however the ladies that were running it brought their young kids and had them singing too...weird and not the place for kids.\n\nI dont think we will be back and sadly if the food doesn't drastically improve, I give this place 3 months before it meets the same fate as the other restaurants that have been in the same location.

I'd like to have more options that just hanging out at the bar as it was obvious they were gearing up the floor and DJ for the night.

{"text": "This review comes with a disclaimer: I walked in to meet some friends that were going to dine there for a bachelorette party and when I arrived, they were being kicked out. Yes, a few of them were probably a little too intoxicated to be served and I never criticize a manager for responsible serving. BUT, some of them were not drunk and the little I saw left me with the impression that the situation could have been handled better on their end. F&B managers should have the skills and finesse to handle those situations so as not to lose business, maintain the safely of their staff and guests and make the experience a winning one for all parties. I wasn't there for the whole exchange, but it sounded like they weren't willing to serve any of the party as long as they were on the (desireable) rooftop, but would serve them on another, less requested, floor. The reservation was for dinner but since the girls decided to order a bunch of appetizers and plates to share, it seemed like the catalyst was to save the table for a higher spending party. Why else would they offer to serve the group on another floor, but not on the roof? \n\nI also got the impression that specific members of the party were called out and embarrassed in front of other guests and the rest of the girls. Like I said, I am all for responsible serving, but there is a manner in which a manager should handle such situations and it appears as though this was handled poorly. There a lot of places that people can choose to spend their money and special occasions downtown and in my opinion and experience, managers should not only prioritize their safe practice, but the experience of the guest. \n\nThat being said, I still plan to return at some point and will write a review based on that experience as well.

{"text": "After Marquise left the front office staff, this place has just seemed to go downhill a bit. The front office has a few rude members working there now, who always interrupt me whenever I call to to discuss any issue, regardless of if it's positive or negative. I had to take away a star because of the staff, and another star because I've been living here for almost 4 years, and this year they decided to raise my rent by 75 dollars, which is why I am taking away another star. I've never had an increase of over 30 dollars during my time living here. If my apartment isn't renovated, then I shouldn't be paying a 75 dollar increase. That's just insane. How do they expect to keep residents here by demanding almost a 100 dollar increase?! Plus water, trash and whatever else they charge, I'll be paying over 1100 dollars for my two bedroom, when I could easily afford a house if my credit allowed a home loan currently. When I asked, the woman told me they had no control over the rates. Yes, yes you do, and everything can be negotiated, especially if you still want a resident, who has never troubled anyone with anything. For good tenants, you need to do everything within your power to do so. Not to mention, the prices online that they have advertised are 35 dollars LESS than what they're trying to raise my rent to. Recently they started renovating the apartments, and the renovations are really nice. After asking if they could redo my apartment (just my kitchen and my bathroom) the answer was no, please note this wasn't in a rude manner, but the woman did tell me that several other tenants asked the same thing. I feel like that if several people are asking, then maybe the front office staff should consider the possibility. Another reason why I am taking away two stars is because no one at the front office seems to EVER answer the phone. One morning I had to call 13 times just to get an answer about something to do with my renters insurance, which again I was rudely interrupted several times during this conversation.  Another thing that is absolutely disgusting to me is they put in a small dog park, which... let me say this, is literally connected to a dumpster, so the small park smells disgusting, and to top it off, within the park is fake grass. I took my dogs once, and will never take them again. The stench of urine is horrendous, and the dog poop smell is overpowering. If they replaced this with real grass, at least the earth would soak it up. I do love living here, I absolutely love my unit and the community is great, but I just don't feel as comfortable here as I use to. Hopefully this community can get back on its feet, and become the reason once again why I fell in love with this community in the first place. One thing I will say, is that the maintenance staff is totally awesome, and extremely hard working people. The guy who wears a visor all the time is never doing anything but hustling to ensure his work is done on time and always does an awesome job with any encounter I've ever had with him. They are always quick to respond with any needs you might have, that's another solid reason why I love living here. I can deal with rudeness from the front office staff, but I won't put up with being taken advantage of. If you're considering living here, by all means, check it out. Just keep in mind the prices are higher now because of the renovations, and the staff can be really rude from time to time (Not ALL of them are rude, just a couple ladies I have had to deal with, some are actually extremely pleasant to deal with) hopefully they'll listen to their residents, instead of giving us all a really difficult time. He only reason why I am revising my review is because I overheard another neighbor saying the same thing about her rent being raised 75 dollars, which she can't afford and is really stressed out about, saying that she might have to move to another unit (downsizing) or try to find another community to live in. I overheard her saying the same thing, that 75 dollars is insane. Whoever you are lady, AGREED. What the office fails to realize is that not everyone makes more money each year. I still have the same salary as when I moved into this place. So you're raising my rent, but honey I'm not making more! Looks like I'll have to starve until my next check after paying rent if I can't find anything that is more suitable to my income. I make good money, not great, but I would also like to set aside for my future and not just flush it away by paying rent to this place, because we all wanna ball out from time to time too.

{"text": "I was rather impressed by the cleanliness and organization of this store. And at one point, was very impressed with the employees as well. While shopping, I watched the employees work diligently and were running go backs, all at a very fast pace. I wanted to complement the 3 associated once I was finished shopping. I noticed that they all left for the day while I was shopping, and the closing team was coming in I'm assuming. My experience turned from delightful, to rather disappointed. \n\nOnce I was ready to try on the couple items that I had found, I asked a sales associate to open a dressing room for me. She NODDED at me, and continued to put her items away. Then she looked over at the dressing room, and said \"That one is open.\" In a sarcastic tone and in such a rude manner. I was totally thrown off by her attitude, I didn't say anything. She treated me as if I was stupid for not looking myself. Like she didn't want to do anything but get her shift over with. The doors on the fitting room tell you to ask for assistance, not to look and see if the rooms are open. After she said that to me, she walked away. I know I'm shopping at a thrift store, but you can at least be kind to me, kindness goes a long way. This was just the first incident though. \n\nAfter trying my items on and cooling off about the rude woman who \"helped\" me, I made my way to the register, still wanting to compliment the associated from earlier in my visit. The woman at the register didn't wave me over, didn't smile, just starred at me as I was walking up to her. She didn't greet me, didn't even crack a grin. Not once did she make eye contact with me. She worked so slow to check me out for ONE item. As her fellow co-worker left for the day, she was very sweet to them and said \"Bye! See you tomorrow!\" But when she turned around to continue to help me, once again frowning and not making any sort of conversation with me. She bagged my item, and took my card to swipe it. Then she placed the receipt and a pen on the counter and said, \"Sign here.\" Um, okay... I'm not he type of person to make a scene, I tried to lighten her up by saying, \"Thank you so much, have a great day!\" With a smile, and in no way sarcastic. She didn't even say anything back to me, so I made my way out of the store without complimenting the 3 hard working individuals I encountered when my trip here began. \n\nThe store itself is very nice, well kept, clean and organized. Some items I felt were a little over priced for what they were. Very large space, and wide open.", "stars": 2}
{"text": "I walked in and it was dark, I was totally thrown off by how the store was organized, and I could barely read the titles on the new wall, and the wall was sparse. I came in because this shop is much closer than my normal shop, and I'd never been here before, so I thought I would give it a shot. When I came in around 5:30PM there was 3 people in the store who were playing Magic I'm assuming. No one said hello to me, and it was New comic Wednesday, so I was searching for the New 52 Batman issue. Someone walked in behind me asked where the new titles were, and the person who worked here said they didn't have them. What? Are you kidding? It's new comic Wednesday! Any well running shop should have new comics the day before so they are available to the customer on new release day, I use to work at one! Honestly it was a huge disappointment. I read good things online so I came here, man I was let down. I ended up making the drive to my normal shop, my friend was off for the day, but still when I walked in, I was greeted by someone who I didn't know. This shop needs a lot of work in my opinion, but it seems that they have a good clientele from what I've read. I can only hope for the best for them.", "stars": 2}
{"text": "Are you kidding? Today was the FIRST time I've been here, and seriously probably the last. We walked in about at about 3 in the afternoon, and there was no one in sight, with rap music blaring. Then outcome two teenagers, who didn't even greet us, they just waited at the register until we were ready to order. Our friend from Vegas was with us and suggested this place to us, saying it was the best sub place he's ever been to. He orders, then I order. I ordered the Italian, and a ham and cheese sandwich. About 15 minutes later, that's right 15 MINUTES later we finally got our subs. Our friends looked delicious, meanwhile my sub order was so confusing. The Italian was written on mine, and it was okay. However there was no condiments on it. My fianc\u00e9's sub was a ham and cheese, it didn't even have cheese on it, and again no condiments. The bread was so thick, all I could taste was bread. Because I was starving, I ate half of mine but couldn't bear to eat the second half. I wanted to ask an employee about the cheese not being on there, and why our subs were so bland and dry, however looking up, once again NOT A SINGLE EMPLOYEE IN SIGHT. But between the obnoxious blaring rap shit, I could hear them cracking up in the backroom. Something was clearly more important than their only customers in their store at the time. After getting up and looking at the menu, I then see in fine print that I had to ask for condiments! Funny because when I got to the counter to place my order, the airhead girl behind the counter didn't say one word to me. She only gave me the total, normally when you go somewhere they suggest or ask what you would like on your order. Nope! Not this time! I also ordered a large drink, and I got diet soda, well it tasted watered down, and they clearly needed to change the tap or whatever. I went for another drink, same thing. Disgusting. This place however, has great potential. Clearly, the people here are the reason why I'm pissed. Not the food. Management here needs to boot these two twats, and get some people who have a sense of urgency, and are willing to make suggestions, and aren't just dicking around in the back when no one is watching. I give it two stars because I'm sure that if the little blonde behind the register suggested toppings, then my sub would of been all that I hoped for, considering I was starving, so one star for the food, and a second star for the amount you get for your money. Probably the WORST customer service at a restaurant I've ever had!!! How hard is it to make a sub?! And you took 15 minutes to NOT put CHEESE on our ham and CHEESE!? As soon as they were done they threw our bags on the counter, and disappeared into the back again. No wonder why I always go to Spinato's or Jimmy John's.

The restaurant is clean and well lit, with plenty of helpful servers.\n\nThe food was average diner style food.  We had the french toast (probably could have used vanilla and maybe whipped cream w/berries to jazz it up a bit)...but for diner-style, it was on par.  My husband enjoyed the pancakes, they were large and fluffy (one would suffice).  Eggs were fresh and cooked soft, the way we like them.  The breakfast bacon was thin, but cooked properly.  Skip the orange juice...it was very concentrated and tasted canned.

My parents and sister love the mackerel here, if that's your thing; I have too many bad memories of those fermented fishies in rancid tomato paste to really care for it outside of raw sashimi slivers.  For those attempting to beat back the oppressive curtain that is the Charlotte summer, Musashi is one of the few places here that serves up a refreshing plate of chewy zaru soba. \n\nI also remember the wines being spelled super weirdly.

{"text": "On a recent visit, I was disappointed to find that the food quality and value seems to have to taken a dive compared to a few years ago. I remember when I used to frequently enjoy their bento box lunch specials, their portions were quite generous and it included the usual generic non-raw sushi rolls (which I don't care too much for), sashimi, my favorite Tempura Yam Roll, a fried dumpling, and a bunch of fried tofu. On multiple occasions, the sushi chef even made me hand rolls on the house!\n\nI went back again after a long while and was disappointed to find things have changed...\n- The amount of sushi they serve with the lunch specials is down to just the generic sushi rolls, which were very subpar and tasteless.\n- There was not as many fried tofu as before. Also, both the fried dumpling and tofu were quite cold and tasted like they had been sitting out for a while before being served to me.\n- Some of the few select side dishes that I usually order have gone down in quality and up in price. For instance, chicken yakitori was very hard and dry (I used to enjoy this dish but it was so difficult to chew), and takoyaki was way overpriced and tasted frozen.\n\nIt pains me to say these things about this place because the people who run the place are very nice and the atmosphere is pleasant and humble, but I just did not leave satisfied the same way I used to before. I should also mention that this review is based on multiple recent visits so I could be sure it wasn't just an isolated bad experience. Now I will likely consider other places in the area before I choose this place again unless things improve.\n\nPrevious rating for before would have been 3.5 stars: Good food for great value.

Since I don't like making single-purpose trips, we decided to have lunch here and try a restaurant that was exclusive to this area.

Our server was very friendly and attentive. We definitely felt very welcomed.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we noticed the customer demographic (as mentioned in a previous review) was mostly elderly folks. \"Cool\" or \"hip\" would no doubt be the last words used to describe this place - but in the end, it's all about the food for me...\n\nWe ordered the Chicken Anthony's and Pork Schnitzel lunch menu special which included soup of the day (Tomato Basil), salad from the salad bar, and dessert. The soup was not that great and the salad was nothing spectacular, but not horrible either. However, the entrees were both very delicious and we definitely enjoyed our main course the most. For the dessert, I chose the Cr\u00e8me Caramel which was okay but did not taste very fresh.\n\nAside from those negatives, I would definitely be back again. The Chicken Anthony's was the best of the two dishes we ordered so I would most likely order it again. It is just a shame this place is so out of the way for us out-of-towners.

My fault for not asking.  The cuts of chicken were nice, but the coating was mushy and spongy, as other reviewers have said.  Sauce was bland.  \n\nIt was hard to pick a vegetarian dish since the restaurant's veggie selection is basically limited to the garnishes that go in the meat dishes.  I went with the Kung Pao Tofu; it had a random chunk of pork in it, and the tofu was so soft it was almost like eating pudding.  Sauce was bland.\n\nSide of fried rice was tasteless.   \n\nRestaurant had good ambiance and the wait staff was attentive.

There's no fighting what looks like a small legion of wanna-be hipsters and pseudo romantics who can't get enough of this place or it's food. \n\nAnd who apparently feel great about dropping $50 to $100 for 1.5 ounces of food. VERY impressive. Good for you.\n\nIn my opinion, it ain't all it's cracked up to be: first, pay attention to how many fried foods are on the menu....fried tofu, fried quail, fried wontons, fried chicken wings, fried pork on sugar cane. Yeah - it's a LOT of fried items. They even fry some of the shrimp in their salad items, i'm told. Hmmmmmmm. Bit overpriced for what you get. Some items are either smothered in gobs of soy sauce (duck breast), or have so little taste that they NEED the sauce (spring rolls - lay off the Anise!!). So....basically you're paying higher prices for gussied-up, MSG-ridden, fried nibbles - even if they ARE tapas. Funny how many people write reviews of this place stating that they were WASTED when they went...maybe because we naturally desire greasy food when we're drunk?\n\nI've had friends go and love some items(lime mint beef, red curry tofu, miso) and dislike others (fried pork, gyoza, overcooked fried wontons). I've also had friends tell me they've seen everything from cooks picking food out of their teeth with their fingers behind the counter to death looks from Chu because they clicked their chopsticks together too loudly, or asked for their food to come out on time. It seems he's not the little \"darling\" that some make him out to be.\n\nThe music  (on some nights) can be occasionally good, but also gets repetitive and loud. Sometimes this place tries too hard to be New Yorkish - while existing in the remote patchwork of dirt lots making up the roosevelt district (or as some call it, \"Cenpho\". still looks like a lot of empty dirt lots to me).\n\nAnd occasional HOUR wait times?! What is this: Matt's Big Shumai? It's small food! Get over it!\n\nLooks like a lot of people \"need\" this place to be something it just isn't, for whatever reason.

Most of the bartenders have bad pours (with the exception of a couple.  I think most of them are hired from the free-weights section of LA Fitness and are hired as 'favors' to friends and such), and the drink prices will wipe out your bank account. The decor is nice (and I give them a thumbs-up on the recent re-do that includes extra furniture, calming 'water effect' projection sails on the patio, and a lush rust red paint job in the main room), but they keep booking DJ's who are convinced that they are play-listing for South Central L.A. - and who don't know any pop songs outside of \"Disturbia\", \"Single Ladies\" and \"Filthy Gorgeous\". \n\nThen there are the girls: uppity hipster-ettes in Hot Topic clearance items, faux-hawked scamps with too much attitude, chubby drunks, and the iPhone zombie girls who trip because they are texting the entire time they are there without looking where they are headed. Too many girls. If they were nice or even considerate, i wouldn't care....but the girls here are totally obnoxious. And no....most of this doesn't apply to the proverbial \"fag hags\".

The hummus arrives, and the guy spills half of it on a chair, sets the rest down for us to start on, and disappears. Another 10 minutes pass. No cleanup, no replacement of the smooshed half of the hummus. Flag down another person - he's clearly annoyed as we ask \"what's going on here today? We still don't have the other have of our appetizer. This is bad service\". Pretty-boy McSnarky-face replies, and I quote,...\"can we just get past all this negativity and move forward together and put this behind us?\"\n\nHe's serious. He dashes away and we never see him again.\n\nAlmost another 10 minutes later, other half of hummus arrives. Previous mess gets cleaned. Then our salads come. Then so does every single other waiter in the restaurant in five minute intervals (to ask 'how we are'...in that really uncomfortable \"someone in charge told me to come to your table and be nice even though this isn't my section but I actually don't give a shit\" way). This gets awkward...and annoying and embarrassing all at once.

{"text": "For our Vegas getaway we stayed at New York New York. Every time we passed by this place there were tons of people and the place seemed nice, so on our last morning we decided to give it a try. And here starts the reasons for just 2 stars:\n1. We walked up to the podium a min after the couple ahead of us. Instead of greeting the two of us as well and the host COMPLETELY ignored us! He just acknowledged the first couple and took them to their table, not so much as a smile in our direction. I would have been willing to overlook this if the meal hadn't continued in the wrong direction.\nBefore I go on, a kudos to the management: My bf ordered waffles and I ordered an omelette. About 5 min after our order was taken the manager headed over with a beautiful plate of waffles. He explained that their waffle machine had been broken all morning and it just started working again. The manager didn't want to take the chance that his client wouldn't get the requested order and so decided to let the order go out early. Nicely done.\n2. My bf didn't want to start eating before me and we figured an egg couldn't take too long, so we kept chatting and waited. The table that was seated after us received their eggs and I was still foodless (this was 20 min after the waffles arrived). Just as I was about to say something I saw our waiter realize the mistake and turn a 180 on his heels back to the kitchen. However, he did not see that I had witnessed his mistake and was expecting him to head over to our table to give a small apology for the wait. Not so. When my omelette finally arrived I expected that to be his opportunity to give a small 'I'm sorry'. Not so. The mistake was never acknowledged, quite the contrary, our waiter ignored us through the whole meal!\nThat should teach me not to expect.", "stars": 2}

The cut and quality of the meat was great. But wait? Where was the flavor. Even just a bit of salt would have made it better. I was tempted to ask for steak sauce just so there was some sort of flavor.\n\nWe also had the Frisee Salad which was recommended by the waiter, it was pretty tasty. For our sides we had the potato gratin and Israeli Artichokes. Once again, WHERE IS THE FLAVOR?? I believe the artichoke was deep fried, ugh, WHY?\n\nThe drinks from the bar were great, service was ehh.

{"text": "The gym itself is adequate, if you know your way around equipment and are self-motivated.  I'm a low maintenance member.  I initially chose Fitness Works because of its location and convenience.  The membership dues were also competitive.  I don't like the hassle of recurring monthly dues.  We've all either have dealt with or heard of nightmares about trying to cancel a recurring withdrawal from fitness clubs, so I avoid it.  I signed on for a year and paid the contract in full for both myself and my mother.  My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer towards the end of the contract and was returning home to California for treatment and would likely not return except to visit my young children.  When it came time to renew my membership, I had had no mishaps during my previous year, so it wasn't difficult to talk me into signing up for another 3 years.  When I signed on, the manager agreed to allow my 71 year old mother and breast cancer survivor to come in for a few  of yoga classes when she came to visit, which was about 4-5 times a year, for about 1-2 weeks at a time.\n\nI have 5 months left on my 3 year contract.  There have been errors regarding whether I had a valid membership periodically...I can let those slide.  They were easy to fix, although a hassle to explain every time.  They insist on interrupting my work-out in the beginning instead of after, so I miss my group work-out.  This was annoying and always struck me as not very customer oriented...and I feel I've been a loyal customer.  My mother on the other hand, has never been stopped.  Manager after manager has extended her (and me) the small courtesy of letting her enjoy her yoga class.\n\nSo last week, my elderly mother came to see the grandkids for New Year's.  We came in for Body Flow on Monday and her membership card appears to be invalid, after over 2  1/2 years.  Brendan (manager?) says her membership has been expired and that he will not allow my mother to use the facility.  They say I need to pay $15 a day for a guest pass.  I balked at the idea, not because of the money.  I have disposable income and plenty of it.  I don't want to be vulgar about money because THAT is not the issue here.  I've come in to talk in person a couple of times and left feeling my issue was unresolved.  I was promised phone calls the following day, twice, but no calls.  I called and left messages and my cell number, and no call back in a week.  I was told the manager is busy.  Apparently he's always busy.  The management at Fitness Works has changed since I signed my 3 year contract and there is nothing stated about courtesy visits by my mom.  Fine.  I can acknowledge that.  I was hoping to discuss what my options were.  What if I could pay for weekly guest passes at a reasonable price?  Well, I've had time to think it over.  I've had my fill of passive-aggressive behavior from their greeting staff (specifically, Carlos) and the insincere hand-shakes and promises for call backs from Brendan.  They don't deserve my business.  Frankly, I joined a significantly nicer gym and signed on for another 3 years.  And so long as they treat me right, they're going to get commission after commission from the rest of my family and friends.  I don't know what career goals these \"kids\" at Fitness Works have but if this is how they treat loyal customers, their outlook in business is grim.  The staff I've had the misfortune of dealing with lacks professionalism, are poorly trained and do not represent their company well.\n\nAt the risk of sounding vulgar again, I'm going to say it plainly.  I am a very successful woman who doesn't have the time to deal with staff who don't know how to treat me and my family.  It's beneath me.  I've decided to pass on Fitness Works and you should consider looking elsewhere also.  Save yourself the headache.", "stars": 2}

Martini's were mediocre, not terrible but nothing great. Whenever you see bartenders pouring booze into a shot glass to measure it's not a good sign, usually shows they aren't very good at making drinks. So anyway, bar experience was not up to reasonable standards. \n\nFor dinner we sat in the window deuces. Very nice view, the seats were comfortable but they also sit very low. The table came up almost to my fiance's neck. They aren't very practical. As other reviewers have commented initial service was very lacking. No one approached us after being seated for close to 15 minutes, maybe longer. No water, no drink orders. Once we ordered a bottle of wine the front of house manager was unable to answer questions regarding the the differences in some of the varietals, as was the server that was then sent over. Finally we had a third server arrive to serve the bottle. He actually seemed knowledgeable and was able to answer questions. 1 for 3.\n\nThe menu looked pretty good, and the chef was able to accommodate a special request on the first course very nicely. However, the server did not mention any specials, or what the \"Chef's Inspiration Of The Day\" was. The food was good, above average but nothing fantastic. The filet I ordered had good flavor but was far from medium rare, closer to medium well. Not happy. Dessert was excellent. \n\nAlthough we had a good meal and a very good time here, ultimately it's not an excellent restaurant and that's almost all due to the service. If the servers were more knowledgeable, attentive, and engaged it would do wonders for this place, but until then it's just another restaurant with good food that is held back by the front of the house.
